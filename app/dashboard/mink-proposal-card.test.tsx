  // mount GET resolves — and `findByRole` matches a DISABLED button perfectly
  // happily. So clicking as soon as it appears fires an event that React drops,
  // the preview never runs, and the failure surfaces a second later as "unable
  // to find Approve and apply" with a pristine card in the dump.
  //
  // Locally the mocked GET resolves before the click and it passes; on a loaded
  // CI runner it does not, which is why this only ever failed in the shuffled
  // "Test Order Independence" job. Delaying just that GET by 50ms reproduces it
  // exactly. Waiting on the button being ENABLED is timing-independent.
