/**
 * The Settings landing page.
 *
 * This used to `redirect("/dashboard/settings/account")`, which is why Settings
 * had no home of its own and every configuration area had to be its own
 * top-level sidebar entry — ten of them, which was most of what made the
 * sidebar unreadable. Now Settings is one entry that opens here.
 *
 * Areas are derived from the SAME permission catalog the sidebar reads and
 * filtered with the same `can()` call, so a card can never appear for something
 * the viewer cannot open. Adding a settings area is one entry in
 * lib/permissions.ts — it appears here and in the sidebar with no further work.
