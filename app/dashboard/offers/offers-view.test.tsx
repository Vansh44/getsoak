// ★★ THE SWITCH THAT MADE EVERY AUTOMATIC OFFER INERT, from the merchant's side.
//
// `offers.autoApply` gates every `delivery: "automatic"` offer inside
// `disqualify` (`auto_apply_off`), before the pricing engine ever sees it. With
// it off a merchant's buy-1-get-1 charged full price online and at the till —
// and this table reported it as plainly "Active", which is the one word they
// check when the storefront disagrees with the dashboard.
//
// These pin the three states in BOTH directions, because the failure mode of
// the fix is its own lie: a "Not applying" badge on an offer that works is
// worse than the silence it replaced.
