// exists so the cart shows the same number the shopper will be charged, and so
// the near-miss nudge can be honest about what adding an item would earn.

// ★ THE ENGINE DECIDES, NOT THIS HOOK. Under best-offer-wins whether an offer
// applies depends on what it competes with, so a cart that computed
// "threshold − subtotal" itself would promise offers the server then declines.
