//   * the OPERATOR is resolved server-side (device-bound; never from the client)
//   * prices are RE-READ from the DB, store-scoped — the client's are ignored
//   * discounts are re-derived and capped, with manager approval above the cap
//   * tax is recomputed with computeTax + the GST place-of-supply split
//   * stock is reserved atomically AT THE REGISTER'S LOCATION
//   * writes run under the service role AFTER all of the above
//   * every failure unwinds the steps that already succeeded, in reverse
//
// There is no cross-statement transaction over the pool, hence the manual
// rollback chain — the same discipline placeOrder uses.

  // ── 3. THE READ WAVE (roadmap Step 20) ────────────────────────────────────
  // ★★ STATEMENTS INSIDE ONE `withService` RUN SERIALLY — they share a single
  // pg client — so grouping independent reads into one transaction, which reads
  // like an optimisation, is the SLOWEST arrangement available. Separate
  // `withService` calls each take their own pool client, so these four batches
  // genuinely overlap and the wall clock is the LONGEST batch, not their sum.
  //
  // Serial before: shift · products · variants? · billing · tax · location ·
  // prefix · customer? = 6–8 round trips. Now: max(1, 2, 2, 2) = 2. Against
  // Mumbai Cloud SQL at ~46ms that is ~320ms saved on the one path whose whole
  // design goal is "least checkout time".
  //
  // ★ BATCHED, NOT ONE PROMISE PER QUERY, AND BALANCED. The wall clock is the
  // longest batch, so a batch of four would have made three of them wait on it
  // — the first cut of this had exactly that shape and bought half as much.
  // The pool is `DB_POOL_MAX` (10) per container, so four concurrent reads per
  // sale means three simultaneous tills briefly queue. That is acceptable
  // because each read is short and the total connection-TIME went down; going
  // wider trades a real pool ceiling for nothing.
  //
  // ★★ EVERY BATCH CATCHES ITS OWN FAILURE AND RETURNS IT. Letting them throw
  // into Promise.all would lose WHICH read failed — and "Couldn't price the
  // sale." vs "Couldn't read tax settings." is the difference between a cashier
  // knowing to re-ring and knowing to call someone. It also avoids an unhandled
  // rejection when one batch fails while the others are still in flight.
