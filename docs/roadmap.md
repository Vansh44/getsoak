# Roadmap — POS, locations & fulfilment

**The single ordered plan, and the specification for each step.** What ships
next, in what order, why that order, and in enough detail to start work from.

Three design docs stay authoritative for HOW an already-shipped piece works —
`docs/pos-plan.md` (register, staff, devices, shifts),
`docs/inventory-fulfilment-roadmap.md` (locations, routing, reservations) and
`docs/returns-exchanges-plan.md` (returns, exchanges, refunds). This file is the
sequence AND the spec for everything still to build — with one exception:
`docs/offers-plan.md` is authoritative for Step 22 (offers and discounts), which
is large enough to need its own decisions doc BEFORE any of it is built.

- **Acceptance tests:** `docs/pos-acceptance.md` — a step is not done until its
  user stories are in there
- **Architecture:** `CODEBASE.md` §22 (POS), §23 (locations), §24 (notifications)

> **Keep this current.** Any commit that finishes, splits or reorders a step
> updates the table below in the same commit — the rule `AGENTS.md` carries. A
> roadmap nobody trusts is worse than none: it gets read once, found wrong, and
> then quietly ignored.

> **★ marks a non-obvious invariant** — something that looks right by accident
> and breaks silently. Those are the lines worth re-reading during review.

**★★ HOW STEPS 14–21 ARE ORDERED (added 2026-08-18).** They fold the POS gap
list into this table rather than starting a second plan — one ordered plan is
the rule, and a rival list drifts. The ordering is deliberate and worth arguing
with rather than following blindly:

1. **14–16 come first because they are about TRUST, not features.** An audit
   trail cannot be retrofitted onto history that was never recorded, so every
   day it is missing is a day of un-attributable money events. 15 is nearly
   free. 16 closes a window that costs a captured payment when it bites.
2. **17–18 next because a merchant cannot currently RUN the business from the
   dashboard** — shift figures live only at the till, so an owner cannot see
   yesterday, or compare two shops.
3. **19–20 are performance.** Real, measured, and not urgent until a shop has a
   big catalogue or a slow connection.
4. **5–9 are the remaining product features**, unchanged in substance.
5. **21, 10 and 11 are last** because each is large and none blocks a shop
   trading today.

⚠ The judgement call is 14 vs 17. If the goal is SELLING POS, dashboard
reporting is the more visible gap; if the goal is running it safely in a shop
with staff, the audit trail is. Ordered for the second, because the first is
recoverable later and the second is not.

**★ THE NUMBER IS A STABLE ID, NOT A SEQUENCE.** Row ORDER is the priority; the
number only names the step. Steps 12 and 13 are newer than 6–11 and sit above
them deliberately. Do not renumber to make the column ascending —
`docs/inventory-fulfilment-roadmap.md` cites "Step 8" by number, and the
returns plan cites Steps 1–4, so a tidy-up silently repoints those references.

**★ WHAT `✅ done` MEANS IN THIS TABLE: the code shipped.** It does NOT mean
anyone has run it in a browser — that is tracked in **P1** and in each step's
own ⚠ notes. Steps 2, 3, 4, 12 and 13 are all `✅ done` and every one of them is
still unexercised against a real till, browser or gateway. Reading `done` as
`shippable` is how this table stops being trusted; if a step's code is finished,
mark it done and put the caveat in the section, rather than leaving the row at
`◐ part` on a different standard from its neighbours.

**★ MIGRATIONS ARE NO LONGER A CAVEAT — they are all applied** (owner,
2026-08-18; spot-verified the same day against `storemink` AND
`storemink_staging`: `pos_parked_sales`, `store_sms_providers`,
`sms_suppressions`, `platform_announcements`,
`order_payments_gateway_ref_key`, `orders.pickup_code`,
`orders.cancellation_status`, `users.claimed_at`, `order_returns.location_id`,
`store_payment_providers.webhook_secret_enc`, and all six FKs to `users.id`
carrying `ON UPDATE CASCADE`). ⚠ That is a point-in-time check of the objects
those files create, not proof that every statement in every file ran — ask the
database, not this paragraph, before depending on a specific one.

**Where we actually are.** Everything in the top block works. **Step 0 is
numbered 0 because it is not optional and not sequenced with the rest** — it is
how StoreMink gets paid, and the old path cannot change an amount on a UPI or
e-mandate mandate at all (`docs/billing-architecture.md` §2). **Pickup is the
outlier**: every piece exists — holds, routing, the collection queue, tender
capture at hand-over, four email events, and since 2026-08-10 the collection
code, QR page and role split — and _none of it has ever been run end to end in a
browser_. Steps 1 and 3 built it and its migration is applied; what is left is
purely the run, which sits in the P1 gate rather than in a feature step.

**Release-hardening P1 is verification-first, not another feature track.** The
ordered gate is: notification actions → shipment/shipping actions → pickup in
a browser → Razorpay test-mode refunds/billing → autopay → remaining exposed
actions. The notification action surface is covered by focused tests for
recipient and host isolation, permission gates, input validation, persistence,
email safety, personal preferences, audience routing and failed-delivery retry.
Its default email layer now has hand-written customer transaction journeys,
action-specific team alerts, contrast-safe store branding and mobile-verified
order/pickup/refund layouts; preview and test sends preserve the selected
audience rather than rendering customer copy with staff chrome.
Shipment and shipping actions are also covered: server-side catalog pricing,
stock and PIN validation; connection and location mapping gates; booking leases;
resumable provider stages; pickup, tracking, NDR and cancellation; and the
manual-courier fallback. The remaining exposed action pass now covers help
centre public/operator boundaries, Shiprocket connection secrets and warehouse
mapping, custom-domain state transitions and store-signup provisioning/rollback.
The code-only action hardening is complete. The release gate remains open:
browser pickup still needs an authorized disposable environment/data set, then
Razorpay refunds, billing and the new counter tender (Step 12) need test-mode
credentials; autopay follows only after those real provider behaviours are
observed. Schema is no longer part of this gate — every migration is applied. This gate does not change
Step 4's place in the product roadmap; it decides when the already-built system
is safe to expose to real transactions.

# Part 1 — What to build

---

## Delivered foundation — Shiprocket logistics ✅ DONE

The delivery lifecycle is no longer an order-status dropdown pretending to be
a warehouse. `logistics_01_shiprocket.sql` adds Shopify-shaped fulfilment work,
parcels and append-only carrier events; each merchant connects their own
Shiprocket API user in Channels and maps every `online_fulfil` location to a
pickup address. Location address lines are normalized for Shiprocket's primary
address and minimum-length rules, including older locations whose house/flat
details were saved in the optional second line.

The order drawer now covers the warehouse path: confirm the packed weight and
dimensions, create the Shiprocket order, persist its IDs before continuing,
assign an AWB, generate the label, schedule pickup and expose the manifest.
Checkout rejects malformed or repeated-placeholder Indian mobile numbers, and
the drawer lets staff correct a legacy order's delivery phone before any
Shiprocket order/shipment/AWB exists, then retry booking.
Every stage is resumable under one local idempotency key. A timeout after AWB
creation therefore retries the missing label instead of buying a second
shipment. A merchant can record another courier manually without losing the
same tracking/order semantics.

Shiprocket webhook and manual refresh both feed one provider-neutral,
duplicate-safe, non-regressing status machine. Pickup, transit, delivery, NDR
and RTO propagate to the order/customer timeline; the dashboard can ask for a
re-attempt or return-to-origin. Credentials, raw events and carrier internals
are service-only, while the shopper sees courier, AWB, tracking link and scans.

**Deployment state:** `supabase/logistics_01_shiprocket.sql` is enrolled in the
checksummed migration ledger and applied to staging **and production**
(2026-08-14). The remaining merchant setup is to set `PAYMENT_CRED_KEY`, connect
the merchant account, sync warehouses, and copy the generated provider-neutral
URL/token into Shiprocket's webhook settings. The callback path deliberately
omits Shiprocket's reserved provider keywords so its dashboard accepts the
address.

**Added checkout layer:** `shipping_01_checkout_rates.sql` and Settings →
Shipping & delivery let each merchant choose always-free, one fixed order rate,
or live Shiprocket courier rates, with an optional free-above threshold. Manual
rates carry a merchant-entered delivery range; live rates include handling time,
an optional price adjustment, and either the cheapest courier or up to five
choices. Checkout re-prices from the selected fulfilment location and freezes
the chosen courier/customer charge/carrier cost/ETA on the order; booking uses
that courier by default.

**Added storefront discovery:** the fixed header now remembers a delivery PIN,
prefers a signed-in shopper's default saved address, and offers an explicit
browser-location lookup. Classic and grocery product pages check that PIN
against online warehouse stock and the same free/fixed/Shiprocket quote engine
used at checkout, showing availability, charge and handling-inclusive ETA. The
PDP passes only ids/PIN/quantity; the server re-reads every commercial value.
The oversized PDP gap below the fixed header and the old hardcoded “tomorrow” /
“free over ₹499” claims are removed.

**Still not in the completed layers:** postal zones, weight/price rate tables,
product-specific shipping profiles, multi-parcel or multi-location splits,
return-label purchasing, weight-dispute and COD-remittance reconciliation.
Those are later Shopify-parity layers, not hidden inside an “integrated” badge.

Acceptance: **PS-SH.1–SH.29**.

---

## Step 1 — Checkout payment defaults, and who pays when ✅ DONE

Two small changes to the same screen, shipped together because they touch the
same state (`995f83d`).

**✅ Shipped:** `lib/fulfilment/payment-policy.ts` (pure + tested — the one rule
the picker and `placeOrder` both ask), the `fulfilment.pickupPayment` setting,
the gateway-gated, online-first payment list and derived checkout default,
server enforcement in `placeOrder`, and the `canRequirePrepaid` guard on save.
Acceptance: **PS-C.1–C.8**.

**★ THE DEFAULT IS DERIVED DURING RENDER, NOT SET IN AN EFFECT.** State holds
only the shopper's explicit choice (`null` = hasn't chosen); the displayed and
submitted method is computed. Two eslint rules caught the wrong shapes on the
way — `set-state-in-effect` (a cascading render and a visible frame on the wrong
option) and `refs` (a ref read during render). Deriving removes both, and the
"don't stomp a choice" race with them.

**★ The settings registry gained its first `select` type** to carry this, and
`saveStoreSettings` now validates EVERY type before writing — it used to store
whatever arrived, on the reasoning that the read side rejects a wrong-typed
value. True, but it left the stored blob full of values that do nothing, which
is what makes a settings bug impossible to diagnose from the database.

**⚠ NOT verified in a browser.** The Cloud SQL proxy could not start locally
(ADC needed re-authenticating). PS-C.3 and PS-C.4 move real money — run them
against a test-mode gateway.

Below is the spec it was built from, kept for the reasoning.

### 1.1 A gateway-configured store still defaults to COD

**The bug.** `app/(storefront)/(pages)/checkout/page.tsx:142` is
`useState<PaymentMethod>("cod")`, and nothing ever reconciles it with
`payConfig.onlinePayments` (loaded async at :158). So a merchant who has
connected Razorpay watches every shopper land on Cash on Delivery — the option
that costs them a courier round trip and a collection risk, pre-selected by us.

**Ships.** Default to `razorpay` once the config says online payments are live.

**★ IT MUST NOT STOMP A CHOICE THE SHOPPER HAS ALREADY MADE.** The config
arrives after first paint, so a naive
`useEffect(() => setPayMethod("razorpay"), [payConfig])` yanks the selection out
from under anyone who tapped COD in the intervening moment. Track whether the
control has been touched and apply the default only while it has not. A payment
method that changes itself after the customer picked one is worse than a wrong
default.

**★ Store credit still wins.** When a balance covers the order in full the
method resolves to `store_credit` regardless (§29) — the default only decides
what is pre-selected among the methods actually on offer.

### 1.2 Prepay, or pay at the counter — the merchant's call

**Today** checkout hardcodes
`fulfilment === "pickup" && payMethod === "cod" → "pay_at_store"`. A merchant who
wants collections paid up front has no way to say so, and one who wants cash at
the counter has no way to require it.

**Ships.** A registry setting `fulfilment.pickupPayment`, section `locations`,
group Checkout:

| Value             | Behaviour                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `customer_choice` | Both offered (today's behaviour) — **the default**, invariant 1 |
| `prepaid`         | Pickup orders must be paid online; `pay_at_store` is refused    |
| `at_store`        | Pickup orders are always settled at the counter                 |

**★ ENFORCED IN `placeOrder`, NOT ONLY IN THE PICKER.** A hidden radio is not a
permission (invariant 5). A store on `prepaid` that receives a `pay_at_store`
order must reject it — otherwise the goods are held and nobody ever owes
anything.

**★ `prepaid` NEEDS A GATEWAY.** Setting it on a store with no Razorpay
connection makes pickup unorderable. Refuse the setting server-side with a
sentence pointing at Channels.

**Files:** `checkout/page.tsx`, `lib/settings/registry.ts`,
`app/actions/checkout-actions.ts`.
**Acceptance:** PS-C.1–C.6. **Effort: half a day.**

---

## Step 2 — Cancellation & refund flow ✅ DONE

**Owner spec, 2026-08-09.** It supersedes the earlier draft below in two ways
worth stating plainly: there is **no per-product `cancellable` control** (the
window is store-level), and cancellation does **not** auto-refund to source —
the refund DESTINATION is chosen and confirmed, Shopify's model.

**✅ Shipped (server):**

- `lib/orders/cancellation.ts` — pure rules + 49 tests: the five-value window
  (`none` / `until_fulfilled` / `1h` / `24h` / `custom`), eligibility, the fixed
  cancel-reason vocabulary, and which refund destinations an order can honour.
- `supabase/orders_01_cancellation.sql` — the request lifecycle as columns on
  `orders` (applied), plus a partial index for the queue.
- Three settings: allow, window (select), approval (select, **approval
  required** by default).
- `lib/orders/approve-cancellation.ts` — ONE implementation of "cancel it",
  shared by the merchant's panel, the Approve button and customer auto-approve.
- `cancelMyOrder` rewritten **request-first**; `getCancellationRequests`,
  `cancelOrder` and `declineCancellation` on the merchant side; the
  `order.cancellation_declined` event.

**✅ Shipped (UI):** the storefront confirmation step (a real panel, not
`window.confirm` — it has to say this cancels the ENTIRE order and that the
store decides, and take the reason that makes the merchant's decision an
informed one), the dashboard queue at `/dashboard/orders/cancellations` with
approve/decline, and the settings selects (registry-driven, so the page needed
only its now-wrong footnote corrected — it claimed cancelling "never moves
money").

**Acceptance:** PS-D.1–D.13. **⚠ Still not verified in a browser** — the
migration is applied now, so nothing blocks it but the run itself.

**★ ASKING IS NOT CANCELLING.** A customer raises a request; a human approves
it. Money and stock move on APPROVAL. Before this, an eligible order was
cancelled outright the moment the button was pressed.

**★ WHOLE-ORDER ONLY, EVERYWHERE.** No item-level cancellation, approval,
refund or state — and none is planned, because it needs partial fulfilment this
system does not have. Owner decision, and written into the module headers so it
survives the next person reading them.

**★ BOTH REFUND DESTINATIONS GO THROUGH `issueRefund`.** It already knows
`store_credit` as a method, so using it for both means an `order_refunds` row
either way, the refund cap applied to both, and the pending-row-first
idempotency. Calling `issueCredit` directly would credit a customer with no
refund row behind it — money out that the order does not know about.

**★ A FAILED REFUND IS NEVER REPORTED AS SUCCESS**, and a `pendingReconcile`
answer is never reported as a failure (§26) — the order is cancelled either way,
but the caller must say which happened.

Below is the earlier draft, kept for the parts still true.

### (superseded) Step 2 — per-product policy, and money back to source

### 2.1 Which products a customer may cancel

**Today** `orders.allowCustomerCancellation` is store-wide. A merchant selling
both stock items and made-to-order goods cannot allow one and refuse the other.

**Ships.** `products.cancellable boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true`, in its own
migration — **the exact shape `products.returnable` already has** (§28), for the
identical reason: the settings registry holds one value per store and cannot
address a single SKU.

**★ BACKFILL TRUE.** Nothing is non-cancellable today, so `false` would silently
change every live store's policy (invariant 1).

**★ WHOLE-ORDER ONLY, AND ONLY IF EVERY LINE IS CANCELLABLE — SETTLED.**
`cancelMyOrder` and `lib/orders/cancel.ts` cancel an entire order. Partial
cancellation is a different feature: partial refunds, partial restocks, and an
order that stays open afterwards — which is really "refund some items" and
belongs with returns. **Owner decision, 2026-08-09: a customer cannot cancel
part of a mixed order.**

⚠ **CORRECTION (2026-08-09):** an earlier draft of this said "Shopify draws the
same line". It does not. Shopify's self-serve cancellation is **per item** — a
customer cancels the unshipped items and returns the shipped ones in the same
order. (Its MERCHANT-side cancel is all-or-nothing, and refuses outright on a
partially fulfilled order.) The decision above stands on its own merits —
simplicity, and no partial-refund machinery — but not on that comparison.

The order page must say _why_ when the button is absent — "This order contains
items that can't be cancelled online" beats a missing control.

### 2.2 Refund to source on cancel

**This narrows a documented decision, deliberately.** The original rule (below,
in Part 2) was that cancelling never moves money, and it still holds for a
_merchant_ cancelling: money leaving with no human looking at it is the one
irreversible act with no physical trace. It does **not** hold for a customer
cancelling their own prepaid order — there the merchant is sitting on money for
goods that will never ship, and making them press a button for each one is a
support queue, not a control.

**Ships.** `orders.autoRefundOnCancel` (section `orders`, **default OFF** —
invariant 1, and confirmed by the owner 2026-08-09). When on:

- a **customer** self-cancel of a `razorpay`-paid order raises a gateway refund
  to source automatically, through `lib/payments/issue-refund.ts` — the ONE
  refund mechanism (§28), never a second copy;
- a **merchant** cancel still only _prompts_, exactly as today — **settled by
  the owner**: they may want to offer store credit, deduct something, or hold a
  suspicious order, and an automatic payout removes that choice;
- `cod` refunds nothing (no money moved); `store_credit` reinstates, which
  `reinstateCreditForOrder` already does.

**★ THE REFUND IS RAISED AFTER THE CANCEL COMMITS, NEVER INSIDE IT.** The cancel
claim is a conditional UPDATE that decides exactly-once; a gateway call inside
that transaction holds a row lock across a network round trip, and a timeout
would roll back a cancellation the customer has already been told about. Cancel
first, refund in `after()`, let reconcile-on-read settle an unknown outcome.

**★ AN `unknown` GATEWAY OUTCOME IS NOT A FAILURE.** §26 already draws this
distinction; it matters more here because nobody is watching. A 5xx means the
refund may exist, so the row stays `pending` and the sweep settles it. Reporting
it as failed is how a customer gets paid twice.

**★ THE PARTIAL-REFUND CAP STILL APPLIES.** `refundableAmount` must be consulted
even on an auto-refund — an order already partly refunded must not have its full
total sent back.

**Files:** new migration, `lib/settings/registry.ts`,
`app/actions/customer-order-actions.ts`, `lib/orders/cancel.ts`, the product
editor, `(pages)/orders/[id]`.
**Acceptance:** PS-C.7–C.14. **Effort: 2–3 days.**

---

## Step 3 — Pickup, end to end ✅ DONE

**✅ Shipped:** `lib/fulfilment/collection-code.ts` (pure + 13 tests — Crockford
base32, so the characters people misread off a phone are not in the alphabet and
the normaliser folds them back), `orders.pickup_code` (migration applied), code
minted at checkout for collections only, the `fulfil_pickup`
capability gating "mark ready" to manager and above, the customer collection
page at `/orders/[id]/collect` with a client-rendered QR, the code carried into
the `order.ready_for_pickup` notification, and `findPickupByCode` for the
counter.

**✅ Also shipped:** the scan box on the collection queue (one box takes both a
scanned code and a typed order number — a scanner is a keyboard, and a counter
should not make anyone choose a field first — since extended to past orders
too, when the queue and the returns lookup merged into `/pos/pickups`; see
CODEBASE.md §22 "the shell"), the code in the confirmation
email, and a per-event **default routing scope** so pickup events reach managers
at the shop it happened at.

**★ `order.placed` DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DEFAULT TO `event_location`.** It fires
for every order including deliveries, so narrowing it would change who hears
about ordinary orders for every existing store (invariant 1). Only the four
pickup-specific events default, and those are safe because pickup has no live
users. A merchant's own choice always wins over the default.

**⏳ Remaining:** running PS-8.1–8.31 and PS-E.1–E.6 in a browser. Nothing
blocks it any more — `supabase/locations_11_pickup_code.sql` is applied
(`orders.pickup_code` verified present in `storemink` and `storemink_staging`,
2026-08-18), so the only thing left is somebody doing the run.

**★ THE ROLE SPLIT WAS SAFE TO MAKE** because no store had pickup enabled
(owner confirmed 2026-08-09) — there was no live behaviour to take away. It is
now covered by tests; `markReadyForPickup` had none at all before.

Below is the spec it is being built from.

The largest step and the one with the most already built. Read `CODEBASE.md` §23
first — holds, routing, the queue and tender capture all exist.

### 3.1 A collection code, and a QR for it

**Ships.** `orders.pickup_code text UNIQUE` — short, human-readable and
unambiguous (8 chars, Crockford base32: no `I`, `L`, `O`, `U`), generated at
order time for pickup orders only.

**★ THE CODE IS NOT THE ORDER ID.** Order UUIDs are internal and `order_ref` is
sequential and guessable (§14). A collection code is presented by whoever holds
it, so it must be random — but it is **not** an authorisation on its own: the
counter resolves it store-scoped and the operator still sees whose order it is.
Access control stays UUID + store scope; the code is a _lookup_ key, not a
bearer token.

**★ THE EMAIL LEADS WITH THE CODE, NOT THE QR.** Gmail strips `data:` URIs in
`<img>` and every major client blocks remote images by default. A QR that
renders as a broken-image icon on the one screen the customer holds up at the
counter is worse than no QR. So:

1. the **code in large text** in the email body — always renders, and can be
   read aloud or typed if a scanner fails;
2. a **link to a hosted collection page** showing the QR big enough to scan off
   a phone, plus the shop address and hold deadline.

That page is `/orders/[id]/collect`, owner-gated by the existing customer RLS,
`noindex`. QR generation happens there, client-side — no new server dependency,
no image hosting, and the code is already in the URL.

### 3.2 Manager prepares, cashier hands over

**Today** both `markReadyForPickup` and `markCollected` require only
`posCan(role, "sell")`, which every role holds — so a cashier can mark an order
packed without ever seeing it.

**Ships.** A capability `fulfil_pickup`, held by **manager and above**, gating
`markReadyForPickup`. `markCollected` stays on `sell`: handing a packed order to
a customer standing there is exactly a cashier's job.

**★ THIS CHANGES BEHAVIOUR, AND IS ONLY SAFE BECAUSE NOBODY IS USING IT.**
Invariant 1 forbids changing what a live store does — pickup has never been run
end to end, so there is no live behaviour to preserve. Say so in the commit. **If
any store has already enabled `fulfilment.offerPickup`, the capability must
default open instead.**

**Routing.** New pickup orders should reach managers **at that shop**, not the
whole store. `notification_settings.routing_scope = 'event_location'` already
does this (§24) and `placeOrder` already passes the resolved location — a default
to set, not a mechanism to build.

### 3.3 Scan at the counter

The collection queue gains a scan box resolving a collection code, reusing
`createKeyboardWedge` and `lib/pos/barcode-camera.ts` — a hardware scanner is a
keyboard, so this is mostly wiring. A code belonging to another shop must say
_which shop_, not "not found": the customer is standing there and the answer
they need is "this is waiting at Andheri".

### 3.4 What the shopper sees

`order-status.tsx` already speaks collection (§23). Missing: the **ready**
notification carrying the code, and the collection page linked from both the
confirmation email and the order page.

**Acceptance:** PS-8.1–8.31 (existing, still never run) + PS-C.15–C.24.
**Effort: 1–1.5 weeks.**

---

## Step 4 — POS customer capture, the Shopify way ✅ DONE

### Shipped foundation — channel-aware shopper history

`/orders` now separates **Online** from **In store** only when that second
journey is real. In store includes StoreMink POS purchases linked to the signed-
in customer and online pickup orders. The split is shown when the store has an
effective POS setting plus an active POS-capable shop, when checkout pickup is
enabled plus an active pickup-capable shop, or when the customer owns a
historical POS/pickup order. That last condition is deliberate: disabling POS,
pickup, a location or a plan may stop future sales but must never hide an owned
receipt. Delivery-only stores keep the simpler single history.

POS detail pages now say **Purchased in store**, show the sale location and do
not render a courier timeline or an empty delivery address. A pickup stays an
online checkout source internally but is grouped under In store because it is
a shop-visit journey for the customer.

The merchant workspace now makes the same distinction operationally:
`/dashboard/orders` has separate **Website orders** and **POS orders** books,
each paginated and counted inside its own channel. POS rows show the receipt,
attached customer, location and cashier; their detail/invoice says **Sold at**
and removes delivery, shipment and fulfilment controls. The server actions also
refuse to move a POS sale into a fulfilment state or create shipment work for
it, so this is a channel invariant rather than presentation alone.

That gap is now closed by the identity work below: every new register checkout
starts with a mobile number, and a later signup can adopt the till-created row.

### What Shopify does

1. Cart → **Charge** → type the shopper's 10-digit mobile number → **OK**.
2. Only that submit performs an exact lookup. An existing customer's name,
   email and store credit are loaded; a new number creates an unclaimed
   customer automatically.
3. The till advances straight to the payment methods. The resolved identity
   stays visible and can be changed until the first tender is staged.

**SHIPPED, corrected 2026-08-28.** The first version copied Shopify's broad
search/create panel too literally and queried while the cashier typed. The
register now uses the faster phone-first path above: digits only, exactly ten,
one explicit database lookup, automatic create, and no second Continue click.
Receipt email and GSTIN remain available behind one optional-details control on
the Payment screen. SMS as a receipt channel is still Step 5; the OTP below is
identity verification, not receipt delivery.

**POS-000023 hardening, shipped 2026-08-29.** Customer capture is now a server
invariant, not merely the intended screen: `placePosSale` refuses a missing
customer before pricing, stock or payment work, so a stale client cannot create
another anonymous sale. Product photos remain on the cart lines. The pickup
counter receives the same safe Razorpay configuration and opens the verified
gateway flow after OTP. POS Sales now includes completed website pickups at the
current shop and its receipt view shows customer, source, completion, line,
total and tender detail.

**Mobile register layout, shipped 2026-08-31.** Sell no longer forces the
desktop's fixed 360px cart beside the catalogue on a phone or portrait tablet.
Below 1024px, Products and Cart are full-width switchable panes; the product
view keeps a persistent cart count and total, adding several products never
forces an interruption, and holding or completing returns the next sale to
Products. Wider tills retain the simultaneous grid and cart.

The counter return is now the settings-driven after-sales path requested with
POS-000023. The store master switch, website-in-store switch, location
capability, final-sale/window rules, required reason, merchant-fault fee waiver
and restocking percentage are enforced again server-side. Refund money follows
the saved original tender; split payments allocate proportionally rather than
offering a cashier-selected conversion to cash. With exchanges enabled, the
return/refund is recorded after OTP and Sell opens with the same customer locked
for a normal fully tendered replacement; the return links that new order. The
replacement can be any catalog item, and abandoning it never erases a return or
refund that already happened.

### Why creating is hard here

`users.id` **is** the Firebase uid, and `multitenant_01` scopes uniqueness to
`UNIQUE (store_id, phone)` and `UNIQUE (store_id, email)`. So a till-invented row
has no natural primary key — and if that person later signs up online with the
same phone, **their signup collides with the row we invented for them**.

### SHIPPED — an unclaimed customer, and a claim on signup

**Migration.** `supabase/pos_13_customer_claim.sql` — ✅ **applied to
`storemink_staging` 2026-08-14** (all six FKs cascading; the guard passed).
`users.claimed_at timestamptz` (NULL = never had an account); till-created rows
get an id of `pos_<uuid>`, which the `text` PK already permits.

**★★ CORRECTED 2026-08-09, AFTER CHECKING THE LIVE SCHEMA. The note below said
"rewrite the id, or update both tables in the same transaction". Neither works.**
**SIX** tables reference `users.id` — `orders`, `customer_addresses`,
`product_reviews`, `blog_comments`, `blogs.submitted_by`, `user_group_members` —
and every one is **NOT DEFERRABLE** with `ON UPDATE NO ACTION`. The FK is checked
at the end of each STATEMENT, so both orderings fail: update the parent and the
children reference an id that is gone; update the children and they reference one
that does not exist yet.

**★ AND THE SCHEMA-FREE ALTERNATIVE IS WORSE.** "Insert the new row, repoint the
children, delete the `pos_` row" needs no migration — but **five of those six FKs
are `ON DELETE CASCADE`**. Miss one table in the repoint and the DELETE does not
fail; it silently cascade-deletes that customer's ORDERS. A seventh FK added next
year reintroduces it, and nothing tells whoever adds it that a hand-written list
exists.

So the migration puts `ON UPDATE CASCADE` on all six and lets the DATABASE keep
the list: adoption becomes one statement, and a future FK either cascades
correctly or fails loudly. `ON DELETE` is left exactly as it was — a different
question this migration has no business answering. The file ends with a guard
that FAILS if any FK to `users.id` still lacks the cascade.

**★ AN UNCLAIMED ROW CAN NEVER LOG IN, AND THAT IS AUTOMATIC.** Customer RLS is
`auth.uid() = users.id`; a `pos_…` id matches no Firebase uid, so these rows are
invisible to every session without a single new policy. Do not add one.

**★ THE CLAIM IS THE WHOLE FEATURE**, and it is ONE statement with every guard
in the `WHERE` (`lib/pos/claim-customer.ts`): store scope, the VERIFIED phone,
`id LIKE 'pos\\_%'`, `claimed_at IS NULL`, and `NOT EXISTS` a row for this uid.
Two signups racing on one walk-in row: the loser matches zero rows and falls
through to an ordinary insert. No lock, no window. Their in-store purchase
history becomes theirs the moment they create an account — the actual CRM payoff,
not a side effect.

**★ IT RUNS BEFORE THE UPSERT, AND HAS TO.** `(store_id, phone)` is UNIQUE, so
without the claim first, signup fails with a duplicate key for exactly the
customers who have shopped here before. Claiming turns that collision into the
feature. A claimed row is then an UPDATE, so `customer.signed_up` does not fire —
correct: the store already knows this person; what is new is the ACCOUNT.

**★ THE PHONE IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY**, and it comes from the verified auth
identity, never a form. A form-supplied phone would let anyone type a stranger's
number and inherit their in-store order history. `normalizePhone` is shared by
both ends: if the till stores "+91 98765 43210" and signup stores "9876543210",
the claim never fires and the customer silently gets two rows.

**★ A COLLISION WITH A _CLAIMED_ ROW IS NOT A CLAIM.** If the matching row
already has `claimed_at`, that phone belongs to a real account — the till
attaches to it rather than adopting. Adopting would hand one customer's order
history to whoever typed their number. **`claimed_at IS NULL` alone is not
enough**: a real signup row has it NULL too, so the `pos_` id check is what stops
one account taking over another's.

**★ NEVER THROWS, at both layers.** A failed claim costs a link to in-store
history; a thrown one would cost the shopper their signup.

**UI.** Selecting **Charge** opens one focused mobile-number step. The input
accepts digits only, stops at ten, and enables **OK** only for a valid Indian
mobile number. Typing is entirely local; **OK** performs the first database
request. An exact match loads the customer's name, email and store credit. A new
number creates a phone-only unclaimed customer and attaches it in the same
action; a concurrent duplicate insert falls back to the winning existing row.
Both paths advance directly to Payment, where the attached identity remains
visible and **Change** returns to the number step before money is staged.
Recording who bought something is part of ringing up a sale, so this is `sell`,
not a manager grant.

**SHIPPED — receipt contact.** An optional email box behind **Add receipt email
or GSTIN** on the Payment screen
(`lib/email/pos-receipt.ts`). It deliberately does NOT feed the notification
spine: that routes an EVENT to an identified customer's saved address while the
receipt box may contain a one-sale address. It is still a `sendEmail` call, so it lands in
`email_logs` and the CI send-coverage guard stays satisfied.
`shouldSendDirectReceipt` (pure) keeps it to exactly ONE receipt: it fires only
where the fan-out will not — no attached customer, or one with no address on
file, read in the same query as the ownership check. A bad address is dropped
rather than refused, because this runs after the money is taken. SMS waits for
Step 5.

**Pickup and return verification, shipped 2026-08-28.** Before a parcel leaves
the shop or a return is committed, StoreMink sends an OTP to the mobile saved on
that exact order. Six digits verify automatically. The proof is short-lived,
HTTP-only and bound to the order, purpose, store, location and operator; the
mutation checks it again and consumes it after success. Resend/attempt limits,
expired or wrong codes, changed/invalid order state, missing phone, missing
Firebase configuration and direct action calls all fail closed. Firebase may
create a phone-only identity while transporting an OTP for a new number, so the
server deletes only a just-created identity with no StoreMink profile after the
proof is saved; this prevents the counter check from blocking that customer's
future signup.

**Acceptance:** PS-C.25–C.47 + PS-PAY.1–PAY.4 + PS-8.4a–8.4d +
PS-11.2a–11.2d + PS-C.48–C.50 + PS-8.4e + PS-11.11–11.18 — **written.** Focused tests cover lookup/create races, input
gating, the customer-to-payment transition, signed OTP proof scope, action
enforcement, throttling, temporary Firebase identity cleanup, cart imagery,
collected-pickup Sales detail, pickup gateway availability, policy eligibility,
original split-tender allocation and exchange linking.

---

## Step 14 — Money-event audit: who discounted, overrode, refunded ✅ DONE

**The gap.** `posAudit` has six call sites and every one is auth or device:
authorized, revoked, clone detected, operator login, failed login. Not one money
event is recorded. Discount AMOUNTS live on the order (`orders.discount`,
`order_items.line_discount`) so the data is not lost — but **who** gave it,
**who** approved it, and **why** are nowhere.

**★★ THE APPROVER IS THE POINT, AND IT IS ALREADY IN HAND.** An over-cap
discount carries a signed approval token naming the manager who keyed their PIN
(`lib/pos/approval.ts`). `placePosSale` verifies it and then THROWS THE IDENTITY
AWAY. Persisting `approverId` is most of this step's value for almost none of
its work — and it is the one fact nobody can reconstruct afterwards.

**✅ Shipped.** `supabase/pos_16_money_audit.sql` (⚠ **not applied** — needs
`postgres`) adds `amount` / `approver` / `order_id` plus a partial index;
`posAudit` gained four money events wired into `placePosSale`, `processReturn`
and `recordCashMovement`; and `/dashboard/pos/money` renders the feed with
per-event filters and a net-out total. 12 new tests; the approver and the
override delta are both mutation-checked.

**★★ ONE EVENT WAS DROPPED FROM THIS SPEC: `gateway_tender`.** The line above
originally listed it. Implementing it showed it does not belong — the cashier
CHOSE nothing (verification either passes or the sale is refused), and it is
fully reconstructible from `order_payments.reference` plus
`orders.cashier_id`. This feed records DISCRETIONARY acts, and noise is what
makes an audit stop being read. `lib/pos/audit.test.ts` pins it as not a money
event so it is not "completed" back in later.

**★ THE OVERRIDE AMOUNT IS THE DELTA, NOT THE NEW PRICE.** "We charged ₹1" is
meaningless without yesterday's catalogue price, and that price moves. A
negative delta (repricing UP) is kept negative rather than absolute — recording
it as a give-away would misstate the shop's exposure.

**★ AUDITED AFTER THE SALE IS RECORDED.** `placePosSale` returns early in a
dozen places; auditing sooner would log give-aways for sales that never
happened.

**★ THE DEVICES PAGE NOW READS `kind: "security"`.** It already called its list
"Security activity"; money has its own page because an owner reconciling a
drawer and an admin checking who paired a browser want different things.

**★ BEST-EFFORT, NEVER BLOCKING** — the existing `posAudit` rule. A logging
failure must not refuse a sale in front of a customer.

**★ NOT `activity_events`.** That is the store-wide audit feed and already
carries `order.placed`. This is till-specific, read by a shop owner
reconciling a drawer, and belongs with the other POS audit rows.

**Acceptance:** PS-AU.1–8. **Effort: M.**

---

## Step 15 — Hourly sweep, and held sales that expire ✅ DONE

Two cheap fixes with one theme: things that should lapse currently do not.

**15a — the sweep runs daily.** `storemink-expire-pending-payments` is
`30 1 * * *`, and it carries `sweepExpiredPickups` AND `sweepPickupReminders`.
So an expired collection sits in the queue up to 24h, an unpaid gateway order
holds stock up to 24h, and `PICKUP_WARN_HOURS` (48) sits exactly at its
documented minimum of 2× the interval. The daily cadence was a Vercel Hobby
constraint that no longer applies.

**✅ Shipped:** `30 * * * *` in `vercel.json` (the inert schedule record) and in
`docs/cron-jobs.md` (the doc of record).

**✅ THE CLOUD SCHEDULER JOB IS NOW HOURLY** (applied 2026-08-21;
`schedule: 30 * * * *`, ENABLED). It needed an interactive `gcloud` reauth, so
it could only be run by hand.

**★ THE FLEET DIFF IS NOW A COMMAND, not an instruction.** `docs/cron-jobs.md`
gained a runnable `diff` of the documented job list against
`gcloud scheduler jobs list`. Reading the table has never once caught anything;
diffing has caught it every time.

**★★ AND IT IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT TWO MORE — INCLUDING ONE THAT DESTROYS DATA.**
Running the diff after this change found `search-metrics` and `analytics-rollup`
in `app/api/cron/` with no Scheduler job. `analytics-rollup` is what turns raw
`storefront_events` into the durable `storefront_daily` totals, and `prune-logs`
deletes the raw tables at 14 days (§32) — so conversion data would have been
collected, never aggregated, then permanently deleted, with nothing to signal
it. Both tables were still empty when this was found, so nothing was lost. Both
jobs now exist; the fleet is ten routes, ten jobs.

**★ `PICKUP_WARN_HOURS` DELIBERATELY DID NOT CHANGE.** The constraint relaxed
rather than binding: daily warned an order somewhere in (24, 48] hours out,
hourly narrows that to (47, 48] — the same promise kept more precisely. Lowering
the window too would change what every existing merchant's customers receive,
which a scheduling fix has no business doing (invariant 1). ⚠ Hourly does NOT
fix a 1-day `pickupHoldDays`, where the nudge still lands at roughly order time;
that needs a window scaling with the hold, as a deliberate notification change.

**15b — a held sale never expires.** Capped at 20 per counter and discardable
by hand; nothing sweeps a cart held and forgotten.

**★ DISCARDING IS SAFE, which is why this is small.** A park holds NO stock and
stores NO prices (`pos_14`), so expiring one costs a re-scan and nothing else.
Contrast a pickup hold, where expiry has to release stock.

**✅ Shipped:** a `pos_parked_sales` entry in `lib/retention/prune.ts` at **7
days** — long enough for "the customer is coming back Saturday", short enough
that the 20-per-counter cap stays usable.

**★ NO MIGRATION NEEDED — `pos_14` already anticipated this.** It ships a
`created_at`-ONLY index with the comment that retention "would filter on
created_at alone, which the composite above cannot serve". The index was waiting
for this entry.

**★ `created_at` IS THE ONLY CLOCK.** Parking inserts and resuming DELETES, so a
row is never touched between the two — there is no `updated_at` to prefer.

**★ THE CAP IS WHY THIS MATTERS, not the disk.** Abandoned carts do not merely
accumulate; they fill the 20-slot list and eventually stop a counter parking a
real one. A ceiling with nothing ageing out of it becomes a wall.

**Acceptance:** PS-PK.13, PS-8.32. **Effort: S.**

---

## Step 16 — Check the shelf before taking counter payment ✅ DONE

_(Rescoped 2026-08-18. Was "a counter gateway payment holds stock".)_

**The gap**, and it is one this branch introduced. Stock is reserved when the
sale COMPLETES, not when the customer pays. Between `confirmPosGatewayPayment`
and Complete sale, another till can take the last unit — the sale then fails
with "only N left" against a **captured payment**, which the merchant has to
refund from the dashboard.

**✅ Shipped:** `shortLinesAt` (a READ, `lib/inventory/reservations.ts`) and a
check inside `startPosGatewayPayment` — the cart now travels with the amount, so
the shelf is checked BEFORE the Razorpay order is even created. A short shelf
then costs nothing at all: no captured money, not even an abandoned order on the
merchant's account. 7 tests; the coalescing and the fail-open are
mutation-checked.

**★ IT CATCHES THE COMMONER FAILURE, WHICH IS NOT THE RACE.** The register's
IndexedDB catalogue is explicitly non-authoritative, so "only N left" at
completion most often means the CACHED count was stale, not that another till
just sold the unit. That case is now refused while refusing is free.

**★ COALESCED BY SKU.** Two cart lines for one product are one demand on one
shelf; checking them independently would pass 2 + 2 against 3 available — the
per-entry clamp bug §28 already paid for once.

**★ FAILS TO "NOTHING IS SHORT".** It is a courtesy in front of a real
guarantee (`reserve_stock_at`), so a blipped read must not refuse a sale.

### ★★ THE HOLD WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED (owner, 2026-08-18)

This step originally specced `holdStock` at confirm + `commitHold` at sale. It
is buildable — `payment_pending` is already a declared owner type, `holdStock`
takes a TTL, and `sweepExpiredHolds` already runs on the (now hourly) sweep — and
it was rejected anyway, for the reason **§22 gives for parked sales in almost
these words**: "an abandoned hold would strand stock until something swept it,
and the shop would reorder goods it still has."

`inventory_levels.reserved` is a counter the sweep decrements, so an abandoned
hold — a closed tab, a cashier who walks away — locks the unit for **TTL + up to
an hour**. The trade is:

|                 |                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem removed | two tills, same last unit, same ~30s → one manual refund |
| Problem created | one distracted cashier → an unsellable unit for an hour  |

The second is likelier and more annoying, so the residual race stays: the sale
fails with the existing "only N left", and the merchant refunds from the
dashboard (§26).

⚠ **Do not re-propose this as a new idea.** If it is ever revisited, the missing
piece is an explicit release when the cart is cleared — that covers the common
abandon and leaves only a genuinely closed tab to the sweep.

**Acceptance:** PS-GW.16–18. **Effort: S** (was M, before the hold was dropped).

---

## Step 17 — Dashboard shift history + Z-reports ✅ DONE

**The gap.** Shift figures exist only at the till: `/pos/shift` shows the live
X-report and the Z-report of the shift being closed. An owner cannot see
yesterday's, cannot compare two shops, and cannot see POS sales split by cashier
or tender anywhere in the dashboard.

**✅ Shipped:** `/dashboard/pos/shifts` — the shift list across every location
the viewer may see (with variance) and a full Z-report per shift. Readers are
`getShiftHistory` / `getShiftReport`; 6 gate tests, both scoping guards
mutation-checked.

**★★ SALES-BY-CASHIER/TENDER WAS SPLIT OFF TO ANALYTICS, deliberately.** The
spec bundled it here, and the overlap warning below is the reason not to: a
Z-report is SHIFT-shaped — a drawer, a float, a variance — and analytics has no
concept of a shift. Sales aggregates over a date range are exactly what the
analytics rebuild is for. So the line is: **drawers and shifts belong to POS;
sales aggregates belong to analytics.** Per-shift takings by method are still
here, because they are part of reconciling that drawer rather than a report.

**★★ THE OWNERSHIP CHECK IS THE SECURITY-CRITICAL HALF.** `loadReport` reads a
shift BY ID with no store predicate — perfectly safe where it was written,
because the till path bounds it to the operator's own location. Reached from a
dashboard the id comes from the CLIENT, so store and `admin_locations` scope are
proved before the report is built. Without it any admin could read any store's
drawer by guessing a uuid.

**★ AN EMPTY LOCATION SCOPE SHOWS NOTHING.** "Assigned to nothing that still
exists" is a real state (their shop was deleted) and must never be widened to
unrestricted — `lib/locations/scope.ts`'s contract, and the mistake that would
promote a bound admin to the whole business.

**⚠ A CLOSED Z-REPORT IS NOT FULLY FROZEN, and this step did not change that.**
`loadReport` reads `expected_cash` / `counted_cash` / `variance` from the
snapshot — the reconciliation figures are safe — but `cashSales`, `byMethod`,
`saleCount` and `grossSales` are RECOMPUTED from `order_payments` on every read.
So refunding an order weeks later moves the takings on a Z-report the shop may
already have printed. CODEBASE §22 states the stronger claim ("reports the
figures snapshotted at close"); it is true of the money reconciliation and not
of the breakdown. Closing it properly means snapshotting more at close, which is
a migration and a decision about what a Z-report legally is.

**★ LOCATION-SCOPED, like every other order read** (`admin_locations`, §23). A
branch manager sees their own shop. This is also where the scope story gets its
first real test, since the till path never needed it.

**⚠ THIS OVERLAPS THE ANALYTICS REBUILD.** `docs/analytics-and-search-console-plan.md`
covers commerce widgets and the missing location filter. Decide once whether POS
reporting lives there or here; two homes for "how did the shop do" is the split
this codebase keeps paying for.

**Effort: M.**

---

## Step 18 — Collection counter: deposits + expiry banner ✅ DONE

Three small gaps at one counter, worth doing together because they touch the
same screen and the same action.

- **A collection cannot be part-paid.** The tender pad must cover the full
  amount owed. A customer who wants to pay half now has no path.
- **A collection cannot be discounted.** The price was agreed at checkout and
  discounting is owner-only (§22) — so this needs the same approval machinery
  the sell counter has, not an exception.
- **`order.pickup_expiring` is email-only.** No in-app banner, so a shop working
  the queue cannot see which parcels are about to lapse.

### ✅ Deposits — a short payment does not hand the parcel over

**Owner's decision, 2026-08-18:** take the money, keep the parcel. No third
pickup state, no schema change. `markCollected`'s claim is awaiting|ready →
collected and a part-paid collection is neither, so the partial branch RECORDS
the payment and skips the claim entirely.

**★★ THE REAL WORK WAS `amountDueAtCollection`, NOT THE UI.** It derived owed
from the order row alone, so a customer who left a ₹200 deposit would have been
asked for the full ₹340 on their next visit — ₹540 taken for a ₹340 order, and a
drawer reporting OVER by the deposit. It now takes `paidSoFar`, read by one
shared `paidSoFarFor` so the queue, a scanned code and the charge cannot
disagree.

**★ THE CAP IS THE INVARIANT.** Every deposit and the final collection claim
locks the same order row, then re-reads payments INSIDE the writing transaction.
Two counters therefore serialize before deciding what is still owed; a stale
outer read can neither over-collect nor leave a newly settled parcel silently
in the deposit state. ⚠ The cap fires on a RACE, not on a big number: a payment
larger than what is owed is an over-payment on the full path, where cash
legitimately gives change.

**★★ CLAIM + CREDIT + TENDERS COMMIT TOGETHER.** The collected transition,
store-credit spend and every `order_payments` insert are one service-role
transaction. A failed tender insert rolls the claim and credit back rather than
returning success with money missing from reconciliation.

**★ DRAWER ATTRIBUTION BELONGS TO THE TENDER.** Migration
`20260822_0013_payment_shift_attribution` adds `order_payments.shift_id` and
backfills legacy rows. Deposits can span shifts, so stamping mutable
`orders.shift_id` could never identify which drawer took each payment. The open
shift requirement now applies to deposits as well as the final payment.

**★ NO STORE CREDIT ON A DEPOSIT.** Its exactly-once guarantee comes from
running inside the claim's transaction (§29); with no claim there is nothing to
make it exactly-once and a double-tap would deduct a balance twice.

**⚠ NOT IDEMPOTENT, and neither is the sell counter.** Two deliberate taps
record twice, capped at the amount owed. That is the till's existing posture —
the human sees the outcome — and `paidSoFar` on the row makes a duplicate
visible rather than silent.

### ✅ The expiry banner

`isExpiringSoon` + a banner above "Ready to collect". The row already said
"2 days left"; nothing SUMMARISED it, so on a queue of twenty the urgent one had
to be found by reading every row.

**★ READY ONLY.** A parcel still to pack is the SHOP's work and the deadline is
not yet the customer's problem.

**★★ MARK READY MOVES THE CONFIRMED ROW LOCALLY.** The server write still lands
first, so a failed notification/update can never look successful. On success,
the counter changes the order to `ready` in the queue, search results and open
detail immediately; the row moves from **To prepare** to **Ready to collect**
without waiting for the next poll or a manual reload. Only a completed hand-over
removes it from the work queue.

**★ `PICKUP_WARN_HOURS` MOVED to `lib/pos/collection-state.ts`** (pure) and is
re-exported from the `server-only` `pickup.ts`. The counter and the customer's
email now share ONE number — a second copy is how the till and the email start
disagreeing about which parcels are urgent.

### ❌ Discount — dropped, by decision

**Owner, 2026-08-18: use a refund instead.** A collection is already placed and
INVOICED, with GST computed against `orders.total` and an `order_ref` issued.
"Knock ₹50 off because it is damaged" is a partial refund or store credit —
both already built (§26, §29), both leaving a proper record. A discount path
here would mutate a placed sale and move the tax base.

⚠ Do not re-propose this as "the till can discount, why not the counter". The
till discounts a sale it is CREATING; this would alter one already issued.

**Effort: M.**

---

## Step 19 — Catalogue delta sync ✅ DONE

Every register re-pulls the WHOLE catalogue every 5 minutes, keyset-paged at 300
products a page — O(catalogue) per till, forever. A 20,000-SKU shop with four
tills does that 48 times an hour.

**✅ Shipped.** `getCatalogSnapshot(cursor, since)` returns changes, REMOVALS and
a server-issued watermark; `mergeCatalogDelta` folds them into the cache;
`use-catalog` keeps the watermark and falls back to a full pull every 30 minutes.
The full pull also returns a watermark—otherwise delta mode never starts.

**★★ THE WATERMARK QUESTION WAS SETTLED AGAINST THE LIVE SCHEMA, NOT ASSUMED.**
`products.updated_at` is maintained by `update_catalog_updated_at()` — a BEFORE
UPDATE FOR EACH ROW trigger whose whole body is `NEW.updated_at = NOW()`. So it
moves on a content edit AND on a stock change, because the inventory aggregate
trigger issues `UPDATE products SET stock = …` and that fires it too. Verified
2026-08-21 by reading `pg_proc`; the doubt raised beforehand (from reading only
the aggregate trigger's SET list) was WRONG, and CODEBASE §7's claim was right.

**⚠ `product_variants` HAS NO `updated_at` COLUMN AT ALL.** Variants are covered
only INDIRECTLY: their stock moves through the same aggregate, and the product
editor writes the product row on save. A future variant-only write path that
skips the product row would be invisible to this delta. Pinned by a comment at
the predicate.

**★ THE CACHE IS NOT AUTHORITATIVE, and that is what makes this safe.**
`placePosSale` re-reads price and re-reserves, so a delta that misses something
is a wrong label at worst, never a wrong charge. A full re-sync stays available
as the recovery path.

**⚠ DELETES ARE THE TRAP — and they split in two.**

- **UNPUBLISHED** is handled: a delta pages one keyset-ordered stream of ALL
  changed product rows. Published members expand into catalog items and every
  withdrawn member becomes a `removedProductId`. Removals therefore share the
  cursor and cannot disappear behind a separate 300-row cap.
- **HARD-DELETED cannot be**: the row is gone, so no query can name it. The
  30-minute full reconcile is the only thing that ever notices, which makes it
  a CORRECTNESS interval rather than a tuning knob — lengthen it and the window
  in which a till offers a deleted product grows in step.

**★ A FULL PULL REPLACES; A DELTA MERGES.** Treating a delta as a replacement
would leave the register holding only what changed in the last five minutes — an
empty till on a quiet morning.

**★ A PRODUCT IS REPLACED WHOLESALE, not upserted per SKU.** A delta carries
every sellable SKU under a product, so upserting by product+variant would leave
a DELETED variant behind forever: the delta stops mentioning it, which is
indistinguishable from "unchanged". Mutation-checked.

**★ THE WATERMARK IS SERVER-ISSUED, BACKDATED 10s, AND CAPTURED AT SYNC START.**
A browser clock would let a fast till skip everything changed in between,
permanently. Every page returns a boundary, but the client keeps the earliest
one from the run: if a large sync lasts more than 10 seconds, advancing to the
last page's newer clock could skip a row changed after page 1 had passed it.
Re-sending is free—the merge is an upsert—while missing is not.

**★ THE CACHE VERSION WAS BUMPED (v2 → v3).** A v2 entry has no watermark, and
serving one would make the first sync a delta with no `since` — which the server
reads as a full pull. Correct, but only by accident.

**Effort: M.**

---

## Step 20 — `placePosSale` round trips ✅ done

**Shipped.** The sell path's read phase went from **6–8 serial round trips to 2**.
At Mumbai Cloud SQL's ~46ms that is roughly **320ms off every sale**, on the one
code path whose whole design goal is "least checkout time".

### ★★ THE PLAN SAID "11 TRANSACTIONS". THE REAL NUMBER WAS WORSE

Counting `withService` calls undercounts, because **statements inside ONE
`withService` share a single pg client and therefore run SERIALLY**. Two of the
blocks held several statements each, so a 3-line sale with a customer attached
actually made ~19 round trips, not 11.

The corollary is the uncomfortable one: **grouping independent reads into one
transaction — which reads like an optimisation — was the slowest arrangement
available.** `withService` calls `getPool().connect()`, so separate calls take
separate pool clients and genuinely overlap. Splitting the groups APART is what
made them fast.

### What changed

Four concurrent batches, replacing eight serial reads:

| batch     | statements                    | on failure                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| counter   | customer (only when attached) | "Couldn't verify the customer."       |
| catalogue | products · variants           | "Couldn't price the sale."            |
| tax       | billing · tax classes         | "Couldn't read tax settings."         |
| till      | location · open shift         | "Couldn't read this till's settings." |

Plus the receipt prefix, which was **its own round trip on the sell path for a
column on the same row as the state code** — it now rides along with it.

### ★ BALANCED, NOT MAXIMALLY PARALLEL

The wall clock is the LONGEST batch, so balance matters more than count. The
first cut of this used three batches and left one holding four statements — it
bought half as much for the same complexity. Four batches of ≤2 gets the wall to
2 round trips.

Going wider is not free: `DB_POOL_MAX` is **10 per container**, so four
concurrent reads per sale means three simultaneous tills briefly queue. That is
acceptable because each read is short and total connection-TIME went DOWN; going
wider would trade a real ceiling for no further win.

### ★★ A BUG FELL OUT OF IT

`currentShiftIdFor` swallowed its own errors and returned `null`, on the sound
reasoning that a sale must never fail because the drawer lookup did. But under
`pos.requireOpenShift` that null means "no shift open" — so **an unreachable
database refused the sale with "Open a shift before selling."**, sending a
cashier to open a drawer that was already open. The till batch owns the failure
now, so an outage reads as an outage. Regression-tested, mutation-checked.

### ★ ERROR PRECEDENCE IS PRESERVED DELIBERATELY

Results are checked in the order they used to RUN in — customer, shift, prices,
tax — not the order the batches are declared. Reading them in declaration order
silently reshuffles which problem a cashier is told about first. ⚠ The first
attempt got this wrong in both directions, and the outage test above passed
anyway because it happened to break the batch that was checked first. Failing
the RIGHT read is what made it a real test.

### ★★ THE CONCURRENCY ITSELF IS PINNED

Every other test passes just as happily when the reads run one after another —
the values are identical either way — so serialising them is an **invisible**
regression. One test measures peak in-flight `withService` calls.

⚠ **The first mutation written against it proved nothing**: swapping
`Promise.all` for a sequential loop does NOT serialise anything, because the
array literal has already invoked all four batches by then. Concurrency comes
from eager invocation, not from `Promise.all`. The mutation that works delays
each batch's start. Second time this session a mutation silently failed to
change behaviour — **expect the mutation to fail the test, and treat it passing
as a broken mutation, not a passing suite.**

### Not done here

- **The `reserve_stock_at` loop is still one round trip per line.** Folding it
  into a single statement over a `VALUES` list would make it 1 RTT _and_ atomic
  — strictly better than the current per-line loop with its manual unwind. It is
  out of scope because it changes rollback semantics on the money path, and
  staging cannot exercise it (see below). Worth doing next.
- The write chain (order → stock → items → payments) is untouched. It unwinds in
  reverse on failure and collapsing steps that must unwind INDEPENDENTLY would
  trade latency for a half-committed sale.

### ⚠ Measured in theory, not on a till

The round-trip COUNT is verified; the ~320ms is arithmetic from the known ~46ms
RTT, not a measurement. **Staging has products but zero `store_locations` rows**,
so no store there can ring a sale at all — this could not be timed end to end.

---

## Step 5 — Receipts

**Email is DONE** — it shipped with Step 4, because capturing an address that
nothing sends to would be a field promising a receipt that never arrives.

### ★★ CORRECTED 2026-08-15, AFTER CHECKING TRAI'S RULES

**This step said "unlocking them is the work; the fan-out, the queue and the
templates exist." That is wrong, and wrong in a way that changes the design.**

TRAI's TCCCPR requires every business sending commercial SMS to an Indian number
to register on an operator-run **DLT** portal. Three things are registered, and
all three are per-BUSINESS, not per-platform:

1. the **Principal Entity** (a PE-ID),
2. the **sender header** — 6 characters, alphabetic for transactional,
3. **every message template**, with its variables marked.

A message whose body does not match an approved template, or whose header is not
registered to that entity, is **blocked at the carrier**. It does not bounce and
it does not error usefully — it simply never arrives. Registration takes
**7–21 business days**.

Three consequences, none of them optional:

**★ SMS IS BYO PER STORE, LIKE RAZORPAY (§18), NOT PLATFORM-WIDE LIKE EMAIL.**
StoreMink cannot send from a generic header, because the header IS the
merchant's registered identity. There is no "turn on SMS" switch that could ever
work on its own — which is why `available: false` must not simply be flipped.

**★★ IT BREAKS THE FREE-TEXT TEMPLATE MODEL.** §24's merchant templates are free
text with `{{token}}` substitution, validated only for unknown tokens. DLT is the
opposite: the body is FIXED at registration and only marked variables may vary.
An SMS body therefore cannot be authored in the notification console the way an
email body is — it is authored on the DLT portal, approved there, and MIRRORED
here with its template id.

**★ A SEGMENT IS A UNIT OF COST, AND ONE CHARACTER RE-PRICES A WHOLE MESSAGE.**
GSM-7 fits 160 characters; a single character outside that set — an emoji, curly
quotes, or **₹** — forces the entire message to UCS-2 at 70. A 150-character
template costs one segment until someone types a rupee sign, then three.

### Shipped — the pure rules

`lib/sms/dlt.ts` (+ 30 tests), which is all of the above that can be settled
without a provider account, a merchant registration or a phone:
`checkDltTemplate`, `renderDltBody` (positional, because `{#var#}` carries no
name), `bodyMatchesTemplate` (the carrier asks this, so we ask it first),
`normalizeSenderHeader`, and `smsSegments`.

⚠ Deliberately NOT encoded: the maximum variables per template, and whether a
variable may open a message. Operator documentation asserts these
inconsistently, and a rule invented here would reject templates the merchant's
own portal approved — leaving them unable to tell whose rule they broke.

### Decided 2026-08-15 — BYO per store

Merchants connect their own Twilio account in **Channels → Twilio SMS**.
StoreMink never fronts the carrier bill and never carries their spam risk.

**Shipped since:** the schema (`supabase/sms_01_schema.sql`, applied),
the Twilio client and the `lib/sms/send.ts` choke point with its coverage guard,
the Channels connection card, the SMS log as a sixth log plus a Failures source,
and the DLT template mirror actions. See CODEBASE §37.

### ✅ IT SENDS

All five remaining pieces shipped: the queue worker on the existing email
heartbeat, per-store channel resolution, phone resolution for both audiences,
the SMS tab in the notification console, and STOP enforcement. `available` is
now `true` — safe because it is a PLATFORM statement, while delivery is three
per-store conditions resolved at fan-out. See CODEBASE §37.

### ⚠ What is genuinely left

1. **An inbound webhook to RECEIVE STOP.** `classifyInbound` and `suppressPhone`
   are built and tested; nothing calls them. A merchant's Twilio number needs a
   messaging webhook pointed at us. Until then opt-out is ENFORCED on send but
   can only be RECORDED by hand — the wrong way round for the one part of this a
   regulator cares about.
2. **Nobody has sent a real message.** Every path is unit-tested against mocks;
   none has touched Twilio, and no merchant has a DLT registration to test with.
   The first real send is the first real test.

WhatsApp remains out of scope (owner, 2026-08-15). It needs no DLT but does need
Meta Business verification and Meta-approved templates, so it is a separate track
rather than a cheaper substitute.

---

## Step 22 — Offers _(spec: `docs/offers-plan.md`)_

One engine for every discount: codes, automatic offers, product/category
scoping, Buy X get Y, tiers, free shipping, gift with purchase — across the
storefront, the till, or both. **`docs/offers-plan.md` is authoritative**; this
is the place in the sequence and the reason it sits here.

**Today merchants have two shapes and no others**: a coupon code taking a
percentage or a rupee amount off the whole cart, and a cashier typing a number.
No automatic discount, nothing scoped to a product or category, nothing at the
till, no per-customer limit, no budget cap. And `/dashboard/promotions` is a
registered sidebar entry with **no route behind it** — every merchant whose role
grants it sees a link that 404s.

**★ WHY IT SITS SECOND, ABOVE 6–11.** Every step below it improves something a
shop already does; this is the largest thing a merchant expects and cannot do at
all. It is also the step whose foundations cannot be retrofitted — see the phase
note below.

**★ PHASE A IS THE WHOLE RISK, and it is deliberately one big phase.** Four of
its pieces cannot be added later without rewriting what shipped:

1. **Per-line discount allocation.** `orders.discount` is allocated across lines
   _proportionally_ by `computeTax`, and `refundBreakdown` re-allocates it the
   same way. A product-scoped or BXGY discount is **not** proportional, so
   storing it there mis-files GST on every discounted invoice and over-refunds
   every partial return — a returned Buy-1-Get-1 free item refunds full price,
   so the customer keeps the goods and takes the money. `offers-plan.md` §8.
2. **One pure engine, wired to both counters on day one.** This is the
   `posTotals` incident (a ₹238 cart rung at ₹249.90, change short by ₹11.90,
   and the panel refusing the total it had just quoted). Shipping the engine
   behind `placeOrder` alone guarantees a second implementation for the till.
3. **Best-offer-wins evaluation** (owner, 2026-09-02). The engine picks the
   combination that saves the customer most — exclusive selection by value, via
   a bounded three-scenario comparison, with `priority` demoted to a tie-break.
   ★ It must NOT be built as optimal assignment: that is exponential and
   unbounded in the number of offers a merchant creates. It also shapes the
   evaluation loop, which the near-miss nudge shares.
4. **Limits — now load-bearing, not prudent.** `increment_coupon_usage` is one
   global counter and structurally cannot answer "once per customer". And
   because best-offer-wins takes the choice of which offer applies away from the
   merchant, the **budget cap** and a **per-order depth ceiling** are the only
   things standing between a mistyped offer and every order taking it.

**Watch for:** the free-shipping offer versus the existing
`store_shipping_settings` free-above threshold — two authorities over one number
(§14 of the plan; an offer may only ever make shipping cheaper). A free gift is
stock leaving the shelf and needs the same reservation as a paid line, plus a
GST answer before it ships. And **do not re-propose discounting at the
collection counter** — Step 18 dropped it, twice: offers apply at sale creation,
never to a sale already invoiced.

**★ ALSO IN PHASE A, BECAUSE DECISION 3 MAKES THEM REQUIREMENTS:** the
**near-miss nudge** ("₹200 away from free delivery" — it needs the engine to
evaluate _unsatisfied_ triggers rather than short-circuiting, so it is the same
loop) and the offer editor's **historical replay** ("this would have applied to
34 of your last 100 orders") — the only way a merchant can predict a system that
no longer follows their ordering.

**Decisions: all settled** (owner, 2026-09-02; plan §18). Best offer wins ·
`maxActiveOffers` free 3 / Basic+ unlimited with every type on every plan · Mink
gets full offer authority behind its own default-off gate, with a mandatory
budget cap and activation as a separate approval · `offers.onSalePrice` is
configurable (`best` | `skip` | `stack`) · an offer may only ever make shipping
cheaper · the near-miss nudge ships.

**Phase A is SHIPPED** (2026-09-02): the engine, per-line allocation, the four
limits, both counters, the near-miss nudge, `/dashboard/offers`, coupons
migrated, and the dead `promotions` link answered. Architecture in
`CODEBASE.md` §39. ⚠ Migration `20260902_0059` is NOT applied — DDL is its own
release gate — and every offer read fails open until it is, so the deploy is
order-independent. Phases B–I remain.

**Effort: XL across 9 phases; Phase A alone was L.**

---

## Step 6 — Channel stock policy _(LOC H)_

Per-location, per-channel reserve buffers: "never sell the last 2 online at this
shop", so the shelf can't be emptied by the website mid-afternoon. Rests on the
Phase E reservations, which is why it comes after them.

**Owner decision, 2026-08-18: it is CONFIGURABLE, not a hardcoded rule.** A
buffer that cannot be turned off is a rule about someone else's business, and
the right number differs per shop — a flagship holding two back is prudent, a
dark store holding two back is two units of dead stock.

**★★ BUT IT CANNOT BE A REGISTRY SETTING ALONE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
PROBLEM.** `lib/settings/registry.ts` holds ONE value per STORE (convention #9).
This buffer is per LOCATION _and_ per CHANNEL, which the registry cannot
address — the same wall `products.returnable` hit in §28, where "only certain
products" turned out to be a column and not a setting. So it is two layers:

- **the store-wide default** in the registry (`inventory.onlineReserveBuffer`,
  section `locations`, default **0** — invariant 1, since any non-zero default
  would silently make every existing store stop selling stock it has);
- **the per-location override** on `store_locations`, alongside `capabilities`
  and for its reason: jsonb keyed by channel means a third channel is a registry
  entry rather than a migration plus a check to forget in every consumer.

**★ THE BUFFER BELONGS TO `available`, NOT TO `on_hand`.** Phase E already
defines `available = on_hand − reserved`; a buffer is a third subtrahend and
must land in the same place, or the two definitions drift and one of them is
what the storefront reads. Concretely `online_stock` becomes
`SUM(on_hand − reserved − buffer)` over online-fulfil locations, floored at 0.

**★ IT MUST NOT BLOCK THE TILL.** The buffer's entire purpose is to hold stock
BACK for the counter, so applying it to `placePosSale` would reserve units
against the very sale it exists to protect. It is an ONLINE-channel rule, and
the POS path must be tested to prove it ignores it.

---

## Step 7 — Transfer dispatch note _(LOC I — rescoped 2026-08-18)_

**★★ THE IN-TRANSIT STOCK BUCKET IS CANCELLED (owner, 2026-08-18).** The
original step is struck out below. A POS manages one location's stock, so a
transfer is two ordinary adjustments — Delhi counts it out, Mumbai counts it in
when the van arrives — and modelling a third place stock can "be" buys tracking
nobody asked for.

**What ships instead:** a **transfer note** — a printable document naming the
destination, the items and the quantities, generated when stock is counted out.

**★ IT IS A ROW FIRST AND PAPER SECOND, and that distinction is the whole
value.** A printed sheet with no record behind it cannot be received against:
the destination re-keys the quantities by hand, two people can both "receive"
the same delivery and double-count it, and a van that never arrives is
indistinguishable from a miscount at either end. So `stock_transfers` +
`stock_transfer_items` hold what was sent, and receiving CLAIMS the note —
a conditional UPDATE on `received_at IS NULL`, the pattern every exactly-once
path here already uses (the cancel-restock claim, `billing_claim_downgrade`).
The print view is then a view of the row.

**★ ACCEPT THAT TOTAL STOCK DIPS WHILE THE VAN IS MOVING, KNOWINGLY.**
`products.stock` is `SUM(on_hand)`, so counting out at Delhi before counting in
at Mumbai understates what the business owns for the length of the journey.
Two reasons this is tolerable, and one thing it means:

- for SELLING it is correct — `online_stock` counts only `online_fulfil`
  locations, and units on a van genuinely cannot be shipped from Delhi;
- the dip is visible and self-correcting the moment the note is received.
- ⚠ It means **"stock on hand" stops being an answer to "what do we own"**
  during a transfer. If that figure ever feeds a reorder decision or a valuation
  report, the open-note quantity has to be added back — which is the one job the
  cancelled in-transit bucket was doing for free. The note makes that quantity
  queryable, so the report can do it without a stock state.

**★ THE ATOMIC RPC STAYS FOR SAME-DAY MOVES.** `transfer_stock` commits both
legs in one transaction and is correct when someone carries a box between two
counters in the same building. Do not delete it; the note is the multi-day case,
not a replacement.

**~~Struck: the original in-transit design.~~** _An in-transit state so units
belong to neither shop's sellable count while they move, and `transfer_stock`'s
guard becoming `on_hand − reserved − in_transit`. Recorded so it is not
re-proposed as a new idea — and because if the ownership-reporting caveat above
ever bites hard enough, this is the design to come back to._

---

## Step 8 — More routing strategies _(LOC J)_

`nearest`, `most_stock`, `cheapest`. Each is a file registering itself in
`lib/fulfilment/strategies.ts`; checkout never learns their names. `nearest`
needs location addresses plus geocoding.

**This is also where pickup radius belongs** — the lat/lng answer deliberately
skipped in F.1, because it would put a geocoding call on the checkout render
path. Solve it once, for both.

---

## Step 9 — Gift cards

They share the store-credit ledger shape, which is why
`customer_credit_ledger.kind` is an enum rather than a boolean; what they add is
a redeemable code and a purchase flow.

**Watch for:** a balance is money. Append-only ledger, atomic spend via a
conditional UPDATE — the `ai_credit_ledger` pattern, which already solves this
exact problem in this codebase.

---

## Step 21 — Differentiators _(POS 10)_

Raw **ESC/POS** printing (WebUSB or a local print agent, for one-tap dialog-free
receipts), **serial / lot tracking**, **composite bundles**, an **AI cashier
copilot**, a WhatsApp reorder portal, and bulk barcode CSV import. Specified in
`docs/pos-plan.md` §11 Phase 10.

**★ NONE OF THESE BLOCK A SHOP TRADING**, which is the whole reason they sit
here. Printing already works through the OS driver on any driver-backed thermal
printer; ESC/POS removes a print dialog, it does not enable printing.

**Effort: L**, and genuinely separable — each is its own piece.

---

## Step 10 — Offline outbox _(POS 9)_

Sell with no network: queue sales locally, reconcile on reconnect.

**Deliberately last.** It breaks the one invariant everything else rests on —
the server re-prices and re-reserves, so nothing cached is authoritative. An
offline sale is authoritative by definition, so this needs conflict rules (what
happens when two tills sold the same last unit) that only make sense once returns
and refunds exist to unwind the loser.

---

## Step 11 — Full omnichannel _(POS 8 = LOC K)_

Ship-from-store, endless aisle, inter-state IGST across locations, and unified
customer history spanning till and website.

---

## Step 12 — POS payments: a gateway tender at the till ✅ DONE

**✅ Shipped.** `lib/payments/pos-gateway.ts` (start + verify, built only on the
three Razorpay calls already live in production since §18),
`startPosGatewayPayment` / `confirmPosGatewayPayment`, the Online method on the
tender pad, and `supabase/pos_15_gateway_tender.sql` (applied — the index is
present in both databases, verified 2026-08-18).

**★★ BOTH COUNTERS VERIFY, FROM ONE IMPLEMENTATION.** `verifyGatewayTenders`
holds the rule — reference present, not already used, then captured for the
exact amount — and is called by `placePosSale` before its order insert and by
`markCollected` before its claim. It shipped inline in the sell path first and
was extracted the moment the collection counter needed the same question
answered: this is a security check on a money path, and both actions are
independently reachable endpoints, so a second hand-written copy is how one
counter ends up settling against an unverified payment.

**★ `razorpay` LEFT `COUNTER_TENDER_METHODS` AND REJOINED IT.** It was removed
while only the sell path checked — accepting it at a collection would have
marked an order paid against money nobody confirmed was taken — and restored
once `markCollected` ran the same verify. A method belongs on an allowlist only
when the action behind it can SETTLE it. `store_credit` followed it once `markCollected`
gained the SPEND — inside the same transaction as the hand-over claim, since
`try_spend_customer_credit` is atomic per call but not deduplicated by its ref,
so exactly-once must come from the claim. The two lists are equal now, and stay
separate constants: `gift_card` will land on the sell counter first and must
earn its place at the collection counter on its own.

**⚠ THE COLLECTION COUNTER CANNOT UNWIND.** At the sell counter a gateway clash
surfacing at the payments insert releases stock and deletes the order. At a
collection the claim has already committed and the customer is holding the
parcel, so the same clash is logged distinctly for a human to reconcile instead
of being dressed up as the ordinary lost-breakdown case.

The three server-side guards are mutation-checked, and so is the ORDERING at
the collection counter — moving its verify after the claim fails a test.

**★ `getLiveStoreGateway` MOVED TO `lib/payments/provider.ts`.** The three
conditions that decide whether a store may charge a card — connected, enabled,
plan — were private to `checkout-actions.ts`, and the till needed the same
answer. One implementation, two counters; it also gained the tests it never had
(a paused channel, an expired timed grant, an unreadable store row).
⚠ Its failure mode changed in the move: an unreadable store row now returns null
(offline-only, logged) instead of throwing out of `getCheckoutConfig` and taking
the checkout page with it. Fails closed on the money question either way.

**Owner, 2026-08-18: "right now only cash works properly."** That is the right
diagnosis of the symptom and it is worth being precise about the cause, because
half of this step turns out to be built already.

**✅ SPLIT PAYMENT IS DONE.** `lib/pos/tenders.ts` takes up to `MAX_TENDERS` (6)
tenders on one sale, and `settleTenders` derives coverage and change in PAISE.
The owner's example — a ₹500 bill settled ₹300 cash + ₹200 online — already
totals, balances and reconciles. Nothing about the split needs building.

**❌ WHAT IS MISSING IS THE GATEWAY LEG.** `card` and `upi` are, by the original
design (`docs/pos-plan.md` §7, decision 8), an EXTERNAL terminal: the shop
swipes on their own machine and the cashier types the amount and a reference.
StoreMink never talks to a gateway, so nothing is verified — the "payment" is a
number a human typed.

**★★ AND `razorpay` IS ON THE SERVER ALLOWLIST WITH NOTHING BEHIND IT.**
`TENDER_METHODS` includes it; `app/actions/pos-sale-actions.ts` contains no
gateway call at all, and `app/pos/sell/tender-panel.tsx` offers only cash, card
and UPI. So a `razorpay` tender is accepted, recorded and counted in shift
reconciliation as money the gateway never received. This is the exact reasoning
that file gives for keeping `gift_card` OFF the list — "a list the SERVER
accepts must never be wider than what the system can actually settle" — and it
is the one place that rule is currently broken. **Either wire it in this step or
remove it from the list; do not leave it as a third silently-unverified method.**

⚠ Note what this is NOT: a privilege hole. A cashier who can post `razorpay` can
already post `card`, so nothing new is reachable. The damage is to TRUTHFULNESS
— the Z-report claims gateway money that no gateway holds.

**Shipped.**

- A **`razorpay` tender that actually charges**, via the store's OWN BYO gateway
  — Razorpay Standard Checkout on the till, then confirmation before the sale
  completes. The merchant keeps 0% surcharge; the money settles directly to
  them, exactly as online checkout does.
- The payment list gains the method, gated on a live gateway — a control that
  always fails in front of a customer is worse than no control (the
  `RegisterConfig.canDiscount` rule).
- Card/UPI stay external-terminal records and the panel now SAYS so
  ("Recorded from your own terminal"); Online says "Charged and verified with
  the gateway". Three buttons that looked equally trustworthy were the reason
  nobody noticed only one of them proved anything.

**✅ CHECKOUT CLARITY FOLLOW-UP (2026-08-27).** The tender grid and its
"take now" / "record already taken" grouping still made cashiers parse payment
architecture at the counter. Payment is now a short, single-column list with
method-specific next screens: cash asks for notes and shows change; card
terminal and UPI / QR ask for an explicit external-device confirmation; Razorpay
opens and verifies its own payment. An unavailable gateway is omitted from the
till instead of becoming a disabled explanation tile. Split payment follows the
Shopify sequence directly — choose a method, enter that part, review the amount
left, then choose the next method — and completes only after all legs are shown
together. No tender, settlement, gateway or inventory rule changed underneath.

**★★ NO QR-CODE API, DELIBERATELY.** A UPI QR is the natural Indian counter
flow and Razorpay has an API for it — but it is provider surface this codebase
has never called, and §34 already records six unverified Razorpay facts. Every
call used here (`rzpCreateOrder`, `rzpFetchPayment`, `verifyCheckoutSignature`)
has run in production since §18. Standard Checkout offers UPI inside the modal,
so the customer can still scan; and because confirmation is a server-side read
of the PAYMENT, a QR presentation slots in later behind the identical verify.

**★★ THE AMOUNT IS NOT RE-PRICED FROM THE CART, AND THAT IS CORRECT.** A gateway
tender is one leg of a split — "₹200 of this on UPI" — so it is a number the
cashier typed, not a cart total. The cart's authority is enforced where it
belongs: `placePosSale` re-prices the whole sale, and `settleTenders` refuses a
non-cash tender above that total. Charging a cart-derived amount here would be
wrong for every split, which is the case this exists for.

**★★ THE REPLAY GUARD IS A SEPARATE PROBLEM FROM VERIFICATION.** A captured
payment stays captured, so re-presenting the same reference verifies perfectly
every time. Only "has this reference already settled a sale?" stops it paying
for two. That check is in the action AND in a partial unique index, because the
action's version is a read-then-write that two tills can both pass.

**★ THE SALE MUST NOT COMPLETE ON AN UNCONFIRMED CHARGE.** The goods leave the
shelf at the counter, so an optimistic "assume it worked" is unrecoverable in a
way online checkout's retry is not. Confirmation is a server-side read of the
payment, never a client callback — the §18 rule.

**★★ AND AN UNREADABLE GATEWAY IS REFUSED HERE, unlike online.**
`verifyCapturedCheckoutPayment` falls back to the HMAC when Razorpay cannot be
read, which is right for checkout: the order already exists as `pending` and a
sweep reconciles it. A till sale has no pending state — it is born `paid` — so
there is nothing to reconcile back from and an unverified completion is money
the shop may never have received. The customer's money is captured and safe
either way, so "we couldn't check, try again" is the honest answer.

**★ A HALF-TENDERED SALE HAS ITS EXIT.** A dismissed modal or a declined card
stages nothing, leaves the other tenders untouched, and says so — the cashier
takes the amount another way. A cancelled payment is an ordinary counter
outcome, not an error to recover from.

**⚠ THE WINDOW THAT IS NOT CLOSED.** Stock is reserved when the sale completes,
not when the payment is taken, so between "customer paid" and "Complete sale" a
concurrent till could take the last unit — the sale then fails with the existing
"only N left" against a captured payment, which the merchant refunds from the
dashboard (§26). Holding stock at payment time was considered and rejected for
the reason parking holds none: an abandoned hold strands stock and needs a
sweep. The window is seconds, at a counter, with the goods in the customer's
hand — but it is real, and it is why the failure message must name the payment.

## Step 13 — Return restock lands at the shop that took it ✅ DONE

**Owner, 2026-08-18**, and the scenario is exact: Delhi is a warehouse that
fulfils online, Mumbai is a shop doing counter sales, pickup and returns. Goods
handed back at Mumbai must land on **Mumbai's** shelf.

**✅ Shipped.** `lib/returns/restock-location.ts` (server-only reader +
`defaultRestockLocation`, pure, 6 tests), a `locationId` argument on
`receiveReturn` validated against that same list BEFORE the claim, the location
written into the claim statement, and a picker on the returns queue. Five new
action tests, both guards mutation-checked. `npm run test` and `test:shuffle`
both green at 4,583.

**★★ ONE CHANGE FROM THE SPEC ABOVE, AND IT MATTERS: THE FILTER IS
`receive_stock`, NOT `returns`.** This section originally said
"capability-filtered to `returns`". Writing it exposed that as wrong. The
`returns` capability means "a customer may hand goods back AT THIS COUNTER" —
it `requires: ["pos"]`, because someone has to be standing there — but a
POSTED return has no counter and goes to whatever address is on the label,
usually the warehouse. Filtering on `returns` would have made Delhi
unselectable for precisely the returns that physically arrive there, which for
an online store is the common case. So candidates are locations that can have
stock booked in at all (`receive_stock`: defaults true for every type, no plan
gate), and the returns desk is used only to pick the DEFAULT. In the owner's
scenario both shops are offered and Mumbai is preselected.

**✅ AT THE TILL, THIS IS ALREADY RIGHT.** `app/actions/pos-return-actions.ts`
restocks through `adjust_stock_at(p_location => op.locationId)` — the operator's
own location, resolved server-side. A BORIS return of an online order walked
into Mumbai already credits Mumbai. No change needed.

**❌ FROM THE DASHBOARD DESK, IT IS WRONG.** `order_returns.location_id` is
never populated by `app/actions/return-actions.ts` — there is no assignment
anywhere in the file — so `receiveReturn` takes the null branch and calls the
bare `adjust_stock` wrapper, which per §22 delegates to the store's **default
location**. The code says so plainly in a comment. In the owner's setup that is
Delhi: the parcel is physically in Mumbai, the books credit Delhi, and both
shops are wrong by the same quantity with nothing to flag it.

**Shipped.** A location on the receive step — picked by the merchant, written
to `order_returns.location_id` so the existing `adjust_stock_at` branch (already
there, already correct) is the one that runs.

**★ THE PICKER IS SCOPED, NOT FREE.** It respects `admin_locations` (§23) — a
branch manager choosing another branch's shelf is the same escape the orders
exporter had — and the action re-validates against the SAME list the picker was
built from. A dropdown is an affordance, not a permission.

**★ VALIDATION RUNS BEFORE THE CLAIM.** Claiming first and validating second
would flip the return to `received` with the goods booked in nowhere — and only
an `approved` return can be received, so the queue offers no way back. Pinned by
a test that asserts zero writes on a rejected location.

**★ THE WRITE IS A `coalesce`, NOT AN ASSIGNMENT.** It fills in an unknown and
never overwrites a recorded one: a till return already knows its own shop, and
that is a fact about where somebody physically stood, not a preference to be
corrected from a desk afterwards.

**★ DEFAULTING IS NOT THE SAME AS GUESSING.** One returns desk ⇒ default to it
and NAME it; several, or none with several candidates ⇒ ask outright, button
disabled until chosen. Silently picking the first would reproduce today's bug
with a nicer implementation. The success toast names the shelf, because that is
the last cheap moment to catch a wrong choice.

**★ A SINGLE-LOCATION STORE IS UNTOUCHED.** No picker, one click, and
`location_id` stays null so the default-location wrapper runs exactly as before
(invariant 1).

**★ DO NOT REACH FOR `resolveFulfilmentLocation`.** It answers "where would this
ship FROM", which is the wrong question for goods coming BACK — it filters on
`online_fulfil`, so in this very scenario it returns Delhi. It is used correctly
elsewhere in that file, for exchange replacement holds; that is not this.

**⚠ Existing rows are not backfillable.** Nothing recorded where past returns
physically arrived, so a migration would be inventing history. Fix forward and
leave the old rows on the default location.

## Step 0 — Platform → merchant billing rebuild _(XL, in progress)_

Spec: **`docs/billing-architecture.md`**. StoreMink billing its OWN merchants —
distinct from a merchant invoicing a shopper (§17) and from a merchant's BYO
gateway (§18). Greenfield: one live subscriber, so the cutover is a migration
rather than a project.

**Why it is a rebuild, not a fix.** Razorpay Subscriptions cannot be updated on
UPI or e-mandate — every amount change (tier, period, locations) goes through
`rzpUpdateSubscription`, so `changePlan` and `changeBilledLocations` are both
dead for most Indian merchants, and add-ons are deprecated. StoreMink computes
the amount; the gateway only collects it.

| 10 · Autopay — mandate capture + recurring charge    | 🧪 **enabled for verification**                                      |

**★ AUTOPAY IS ENABLED FOR VERIFICATION, AND THE MANUAL SYSTEM REMAINS.**
`RECURRING_CHARGE_VERIFIED` is true as of 2026-08-16 for test-mode staging and
an empty production account. Missing credentials, absent/revoked mandates,
amounts above the mandate/AFA ceilings and incident rollback still issue an
invoice payable on `/dashboard/plans`; none is misreported as a failed debit.

**★★ AUTOPAY'S CODE PATH IS BUILT, BUT ITS RELEASE EVIDENCE IS NOT.**
`startEnrolment` can create the Razorpay customer and authorisation order;
`confirmEnrolment` reads the mandate token back from the verified PAYMENT, not
from the browser; and `chargeMandateViaRazorpay` creates a provider order,
persists that order id before debit, then calls the recurring endpoint. Unknown
outcomes remain in flight for reconciliation instead of being retried.

The enrolment window now passes the server-created Razorpay `customer_id` into
Checkout when a mandate is being registered. Every on-session StoreMink payment
also cross-checks the returned payment against Razorpay's read API for captured
status, order, INR currency and exact server-computed amount before granting the
plan, plan change, location or AI credits. A provider read outage retains the
already-verified HMAC path so a captured payment is not stranded or invited to
be paid twice.

Production returns the charge function when platform credentials are present.
The exact recurring request behaviour, provider-side idempotency support,
asynchronous event vocabulary and failure states are being verified through
`docs/autopay-verification.md`. The first rollout also persists the exact
authorised ceiling on the durable attempt (`billing_09`) and requires both owner
email and phone before offering a mandate, so a successful signup cannot create
an unusable automatic-renewal promise.

**★ THERE IS ONE BILLING SYSTEM NOW.** `subscription-actions.ts`,
`lib/payments/subscription.ts`, the `razorpay_plans` cache and the five
`rzp*Subscription` calls were deleted on 2026-08-13. The `store_subscriptions`
table remains as the old system's audit trail; nothing reads it.

**The migration turned out to be a no-op.** `store_subscriptions` was empty in
production by the time `billing_06` was applied, so there was nothing to move —
and the one live subscriber's gateway subscription had already been cancelled by
hand, which was the step that mattered.

| Help-sweep **fulfilment and document gaps**             | Priority routing compares raw `on_hand` instead of `on_hand - reserved`; missing parcel measurements silently use 500 g and 10×10×5 cm; website checkout does not capture buyer GSTIN or persist a CGST/SGST/IGST split; and historical invoice reprints combine immutable transaction values with the current merchant template/identity. These are product gaps now described honestly in Help, not missing documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# Part 2 — Already shipped

Condensed. `CODEBASE.md` holds the architecture; what is kept here is the
_reasoning_, because several of these decisions constrain the steps above.

### POS 0–4 · LOC A–F

Locations + per-location inventory, the `/pos` shell with staff accounts and
device authorization, the register (GST, thermal receipts, barcode scanning,
local catalogue cache), shifts and cash reconciliation, shop-floor inventory with
atomic transfers. Capabilities, location scope, fulfilment routing, reservations
and the pickup machinery. Specs: `docs/pos-plan.md`,
`docs/inventory-fulfilment-roadmap.md`.

### Refunds & cancellation ★ the unblocker

`refunds_01_gateway.sql`, `lib/payments/refunds.ts` (pure, tested),
`refund-actions.ts`, `refund-reconcile.ts` (reconcile-on-read + cron sweep),
`lib/orders/cancel.ts` (ONE implementation shared by both callers),
`cancelMyOrder`.

- **Idempotency: insert the `order_refunds` row FIRST**, `pending`, carrying our
  own key — you cannot key on a gateway id you don't have yet, and a timeout is
  indistinguishable from a failure.
- **Reconcile-on-read, not webhooks** (§18, unchanged).
- **A refund does NOT imply a restock.** A returned item may be damaged.
- **Auto-refund on cancel: originally NO**, on the grounds that money leaving
  with no human looking at it is the §22 owner-only-discounts argument again.
  **Step 2 narrows this** to customer self-cancel of prepaid orders, default
  OFF — the reasoning still stands everywhere else.
- **COD is not a dead button:** the merchant picks per refund from {store
  credit, manual transfer (recorded), cash at counter}. RazorpayX drops in later
  as one more `method`, no schema change.

### Help Centre discovery and indexing

The public Help Centre now has persistent header search with a visible submit
button and grounded multilingual AI interpretation. AI can translate intent and
rank real published guides but cannot write answers, invent URLs, or surface
drafts; exact titles and all AI failure paths remain deterministic keyword
search. Published articles are required to have a canonical category, appear in
the production Help sitemap with real update dates, notify IndexNow, and trigger
an immediate Google Search Console sitemap submission. The daily SEO job remains
the durable retry, while Google retains final control over crawl and indexing.

The dedicated **Point of Sale** Help category now publishes 17 editable guides
covering the shipped counter journey end to end: setup, locations, staff and
authorised devices, register policy, scanning, sales, tenders, discounts,
receipts, stock, cash shifts, pickup, returns, refunds/store credit/exchanges,
reporting, and connection-aware troubleshooting. These rows are installed by
the migration ledger, so staging and production receive the same public support
content and the existing Help search/sitemap pipeline discovers every guide.

The public merchant documentation now has a broad coverage baseline for the
product that is actually shipped. Migrations
`20260826_0019_getting_started_account_help` through
`20260826_0024_marketing_communications_help` upsert 81 guide records
covering Getting started, account/staff/billing, Website Builder and storefront,
domains, products/inventory, customers/enquiries, payments/GST/COD,
orders/locations/shipping, and marketing/blog/email/SMS. The public taxonomy
has 11 canonical baseline categories; operators may add more later. The
existing POS, Analytics and Mink AI guides stay in the same operator-editable
database source. When the existing
custom-domain guide is present, the batch adds 80 net-new guides and updates
that one record in place. Publication now
fails closed when a guide is missing its category, excerpt, meaningful body or
SEO metadata, and the offline deterministic vocabulary covers each product
area. `scripts/help-content-migrations.test.mjs` is the release contract for the
six content batches: exact counts and order, unique slugs, complete metadata,
substantial bodies, valid internal links, and no links to unshipped surfaces.

The documentation deliberately does **not** get ahead of the application. Do
not publish a Returns-settings guide until that registry is rendered in the
Orders settings UI, or a Promotions guide until the route exists. Newsletter
subscriber management/export, full product-review moderation, arbitrary
merchant store-credit grants, and inbound Twilio STOP handling also remain
excluded because those merchant workflows are not built. Before documenting a
self-service customer deletion flow, fix the current account-delete cascade and
confirmation copy so account-linked order/invoice records cannot disappear
without an explicit, legally informed decision. Shiprocket merchant-account
rates, booking and webhook guidance remains conditional on a controlled live
smoke test, and the Razorpay refund guide requires a controlled first-live
refund plus reconciliation. These are product backlog or release-evidence
items, not missing Help copy. The same audit exposed authorization and data
integrity work that must stay visible in this roadmap: enforce location scope
on order-detail/cancellation reads and fail closed when scope cannot be loaded;
validate amount/currency/capture consistently on every storefront Razorpay
settlement path; route on reservation-adjusted availability; replace silent
parcel defaults with an explicit measurement workflow; and separate immutable
invoice facts from current-template reprints. Email and SMS logs remain
send-attempt evidence, not final-delivery tracking.

Mink AI retrieval now has a durable semantic layer as well as the deterministic
one. Migration `20260825_0017_help_article_embeddings` installs pgvector and a
published-parent-scoped, 768-dimensional chunk table; migration
`20260826_0018_help_embedding_hardening` adds complete-set and parser-version
metadata before the worker is deployed. Published guides are
split at headings, embedded with retrieval-specific query/document task types,
and combined with exact/title/category/alias results through reciprocal-rank
fusion. Exact matches keep reserved places; vectors add paraphrase and
multilingual recall without being allowed to erase them. Missing credentials,
provider timeouts, an unapplied migration, or an empty backfill all fail soft to
the existing search path. Article saves refresh their own derived index, while
the CRON-secret-gated hourly worker backfills and repairs stale/model-changed
chunks in bounded, self-chaining batches. Chunk sets are versioned and carry
their expected count, so parser releases and partial sets are reconciled; an
article-level advisory lock plus a full source recheck prevents concurrent or
same-timestamp edits from publishing stale vectors. Long guides are embedded in
provider-sized batches, and retrieval limits each article to its best three
semantic sections before cross-article fusion. The next retrieval step is an
operator-owned golden query set with measured recall/precision before changing
the default similarity threshold or introducing any approximate vector index.

Mink storefront coding Phase 7D is now implemented behind a second independent,
default-off operator gate. After the signed-in proposal owner completes the
Phase 7C draft save, the card runs static checks plus opaque-origin, no-network
browser checks at exact 1,280 px desktop and 390 px mobile widths. A new
five-minute approval binds that evidence, the completed save, complete private
draft/current-live snapshots and the exact page version. One optimistic,
idempotent transaction copies only the checked snapshot to
`published_sections`, updates publication state/time and records an append-only
outcome; no model tool can click or execute it. A separate five-minute rollback
approval restores the exact previous published snapshot only while the live
page is unchanged and never rewinds the private Builder draft. Phase 7 exit
validation is next; media generation and placement require their own future
provenance, moderation, storage and approval boundary.

The Builder chat visibility gap is fixed: on desktop the shared Mink panel
floats above the fixed editor rather than opening behind it; phone full-screen
chat and maximization are unchanged. No editor remount or new model authority
is introduced. Migration `20260905_0080_mink_builder_chat_help` documents this
flow. Echos acceptance prompts now use ordinary merchant wording and short
follow-ups, with technical attack probes in a separate appendix.

Mink Phase 8A adds requested daily/weekly business briefs on the existing
restart-safe workflow queue. Daily covers yesterday; weekly covers the last
7 completed local days, compared with preceding local calendar days. The four
checks cover sales, current stock separately by location, return-record
activity (original order location) and current failed-payment status for
orders created in the historical window. Insufficient baselines are labelled,
not guessed. Analytics/Products/Inventory/Orders View and captured scope are
revalidated; scope narrowing cancels a checkpointed brief. No model calls run
in the worker. Migration `20260905_0081_mink_phase_8a_business_briefs` adds the
template and Help guide. Echos tests are ECH-P8A-01–24. Phase 8B adds explicitly
enabled owner-private daily/weekly watches, quiet hours, episode/location-count
deduplication, pause/resume/delete and captured-scope checks. The existing
workflow heartbeat queues bounded checks without extra model calls. Migration
0082 and ECH-P8B-01–30 cover deployment acceptance. Phase 8C approved proactive responses is next; Phase
8D approved memory/optional inputs remain unbuilt. Conversion monitoring
requires a separately validated source and is not claimed by Phase 8A.

### Returns, exchanges, BORIS, credit notes

Spec: `docs/returns-exchanges-plan.md`. The twelve `returns.*` settings,
`products.returnable` + `return_window_days`, reason-driven fees, eligibility,
the customer request flow, the dashboard review queue, exchanges (a return plus
a new order, never a third entity), BORIS at the counter, and GST credit notes
with a trigger-allocated serial issued on settlement.

**Deliberately deferred:** photo upload, per-line damaged marking at receipt,
advance exchanges, cross-product swaps, and enforcing the return window at the
till (invariant 1 — the merchant is standing right there).

### Store credit

Balance + append-only ledger, issued from a refund, spent at checkout, reinstated
on cancel. `orders.total` stays the goods value — credit is a payment, not a
discount — and the unpayable-remainder gap below the gateway minimum is handled.

### Metered extra-location billing _(POS 7)_

**★ An extra location is a PRICE RISE ON THE SAME STOREMINK BILLING
SUBSCRIPTION, not a second mandate.** The part-period amount is collected by a
verified one-time checkout; `billing_subscriptions.billed_locations` then feeds
every future invoice. Buying applies now and releasing waits for cycle end,
keeping refunds out of the system. Priced from the operator console
(`plan_prices`, key `extra_location`).

Traps, each already paid for: `changePlan` must carry the count through or the
merchant silently drops to the bare plan price while keeping every shop; the
count is absolute, never a delta; it is written only when the change is live; the
the mandate ceiling is checked before the gateway against the **full next
invoice** (base plan + every extra location + tax), and an active mandate whose
ceiling cannot be read fails closed; counts are refused, not clamped, in both
directions.

---

## Invariants — every step obeys these

They are the ones already paid for in bugs.

1. **A migration may not change what a live store does.** Backfill what already
   happens as ON; backfill new behaviour as OFF. Creation defaults and backfill
   values are different questions.
2. **Nothing cached is authoritative.** The server re-prices and re-reserves.
3. **Exactly-once is a conditional claim**, never an app-level check-then-act.
4. **Cross-location writes are one RPC**, because there is no cross-statement
   transaction over the pool.
5. **A disabled control is not a permission.** Re-enforce server-side.
6. **Never refuse a sale over an optional feature.** Routing and pickup both
   fail open.
7. **Every action emits an event.** The coverage guard fails the build otherwise
   — but note it only asserts a key is emitted _somewhere_, not that every path
   which should emit it does.
8. **Absence is not restriction.** An admin bound to no location sees everything.

## Decisions

**Settled**

- **Pickup capability split: GO** (owner, 2026-08-09). No store has enabled
  `fulfilment.offerPickup`, so making "mark ready" manager-only takes nothing
  away from anybody — invariant 1 is satisfied because there is no live
  behaviour to preserve.

- **Partial cancellation: NO** (owner, 2026-08-09). A customer cannot cancel
  part of a mixed order; an order is cancellable only if every line is.
- **Auto-refund fires on a CUSTOMER cancel only** (owner, 2026-08-09). A
  merchant cancelling from the dashboard still gets the refund button to click,
  because they may want to offer store credit, deduct something, or hold a
  suspicious order — an automatic payout takes that choice away at exactly the
  moment it matters.
- **Auto-refund is OFF by default** (owner, 2026-08-09), a switch each merchant
  turns on. Consistent with every other new behaviour here: nothing changes for
  an existing store until they ask for it.

- **Offers: BEST OFFER WINS** (owner, 2026-09-02). The engine picks the
  combination saving the customer most, not the merchant's priority order.
  ⚠ The recommendation had been exclusive-with-priority, on the grounds that
  best-offer-wins is harder to test and harder for a cashier to explain. The
  decision stands; the cost is paid by three Phase A requirements that would
  otherwise have been optional — a bounded scenario comparison instead of a
  search, a per-order discount ceiling, and a historical-replay preview so a
  merchant can still predict what an offer will do. `docs/offers-plan.md` §10.
- **Offers: full Mink authority** (owner, 2026-09-02) — read, propose, create,
  update and activate, behind its own default-off gate. Two offer-specific
  tightenings on top of the Phase 4C coupon pattern: a **budget cap is mandatory
  in every proposal** (an automatic offer needs nobody to type it), and
  **activation is a separate approval** from creation. Plan §14c.
- **Offers: every type on every plan** (owner, 2026-09-02), capped at 3 active
  on free — a straight generalisation of `maxActiveCoupons`. Gating offers
  behind Basic would have removed the three coupons free stores already have,
  which is invariant 1. Plan §15.

**Open — the owner's to settle before the step they affect starts**

(none — all settled.)
