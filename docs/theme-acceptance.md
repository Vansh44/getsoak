# StoreMink theme acceptance

This is the release gate for every StoreMink storefront theme. A theme is not
"done" because its definition compiles, its homepage looks attractive, or its
demo was reviewed once. It is done only when the automated, storefront, and
human-review gates below all pass for the release being published.

- **Theme implementation plan:** `docs/vertical-templates-plan.md`
- **Theme packages:** `lib/themes/`
- **Automated package checks:** `lib/themes/themes.test.ts`
- **Asset provenance:** `docs/theme-assets.md`
- **★ marks a non-obvious invariant** that deserves explicit regression
  coverage.

The word **theme** below means one catalog choice presented to a merchant. When
theme families and presets are introduced, each preset is still evaluated as
its own catalog choice because that is what the merchant sees and selects.

## 1. Release states

| State     | Meaning                                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Draft     | Design or implementation is in progress. It must not appear in signup.                         |
| Candidate | Package-integrity tests pass and a demo is available for review.                               |
| Approved  | Every required story in this document passed for the current release.                          |
| Published | Approved and visible in the merchant catalog/signup picker.                                    |
| Blocked   | A required gate failed. Record the failure in the baseline table before more catalog exposure. |

Approval belongs to a specific theme release. A change to shared storefront
chrome, a theme layout variant, seeded content, or theme imagery moves every
affected theme back to Candidate until the impacted gates are rerun.

## 2. Automated package gate

These checks run in Vitest for every definition registered in
`THEME_DEFINITIONS`. They are necessary, but they do not approve a theme on
their own.

**TA-2.1 ★ — Catalog metadata and definitions agree**

Every catalog id has exactly one server definition, ids are unique and
URL-safe, demo slugs follow `demo-{id}`, and the default id resolves.

**TA-2.2 — Catalog copy is publishable**

Name, description, brand tagline and brand blurb are non-empty. Placeholder
labels such as "Theme 1", "Lorem ipsum", and "Coming soon" are not allowed.

**TA-2.3 ★ — Seeded pages are valid and addressable**

There is exactly one homepage sentinel (`slug: ""`). Page slugs and section ids
are unique, every page has a title and SEO description, and every section
passes strict publish validation.

**TA-2.4 — The homepage has enough authored structure**

The homepage contains at least five enabled sections spanning at least four
distinct section types. This is a floor, not a design target: five generic
bands do not pass the human distinctness gate.

**TA-2.5 ★ — Seed data can render a credible demo**

The package has at least four categories and eight products, including at least
one featured product. Slugs are unique, category references resolve, product
copy is non-empty, and prices are positive and internally consistent.

**TA-2.6 ★ — Shared assets are safe and production-sized**

Every referenced theme asset exists under `public/themes/{theme-id}/`, is WebP
or AVIF, is at least 800 px wide, and is no larger than 500 KiB. The catalog
preview is at least 800 × 600, uses a 4:3 aspect ratio, and is no larger than
250 KiB.

**TA-2.7 — The design system is complete**

Every palette, typography, shape, and selected layout value is valid and can be
flattened into the storefront CSS-variable contract.

**TA-2.8 ★ — Shared capability contracts are enforceable**

Every seeded video/newsletter/editorial section passes strict publish
validation. Header, card, product-detail, cart, and footer defaults use the
allowed variant registry; the pure resolver preserves pinned legacy grocery
stores and applies merchant overrides per surface. Newsletter action tests must
prove host-derived tenancy, normalized email, explicit consent, rate limiting,
source allowlisting, idempotent upsert, and a safe persistence-failure response.

---

## 3. Storefront behavior gate

Run these stories against the theme's pristine demo store. Test at 1440 × 900,
768 × 1024, and 390 × 844. Record the browser, date, theme release, and reviewer
in the release evidence.

**TA-3.1 ★ — The demo is real**

Open homepage, `/shop`, one product detail page, `/cart`, one seeded content
page, and a missing route.

**Expect:** the first five return the themed storefront, not the platform 404,
an error boundary, or another tenant. The missing route returns the themed
storefront 404.

**TA-3.2 — Header and navigation**

Use every visible desktop and mobile navigation control, search for a seeded
product, and open header/footer links.

**Expect:** controls have visible focus states; menus do not clip or overflow;
search reaches a useful result; no seeded link is broken.

**TA-3.3 ★ — Product cards survive real catalog content**

Check normal, sale, sold-out, missing-image, long-name, and multi-variant
products.

**Expect:** price hierarchy remains clear, badges do not collide, quick-add
never chooses a variant silently, and cards remain usable at every viewport.

**TA-3.4 — Product detail is commerce-ready**

Change variants, inspect media, add to cart, use buy-now when present, and read
all product-information controls.

**Expect:** selection, price, stock, and cart state agree; important actions
remain reachable without layout jumps; keyboard use is complete.

**TA-3.5 ★ — Cart states are complete**

Review empty cart, one item, many items, a long product name, quantity changes,
removal, coupon feedback, and totals.

**Expect:** totals remain trustworthy, controls do not move off-screen, and the
merchant's theme never hides functional error text.

**TA-3.6 — Content pages belong to the same system**

Open seeded story/FAQ pages, blog list/detail when enabled, enquiries, profile,
authentication modal, and storefront 404.

**Expect:** typography, spacing, controls, and semantic colors feel native to
the theme rather than falling back to the legacy storefront.

**TA-3.7 ★ — Content extremes do not break layout**

Exercise empty collections, 500+ item catalog fixtures, very long headings,
long translated button labels, absent optional imagery, and large navigation
menus.

**Expect:** no horizontal page overflow, invisible controls, overlapping text,
or unreachable content.

**TA-3.8 — Motion is optional**

Repeat the main journey with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

**Expect:** meaning and controls do not depend on animation; autoplay pauses or
becomes non-disruptive; focus is never stolen.

**TA-3.9 ★ — Layout variants stay editable and coherent**

For every surface variant claimed by the theme, switch the Brand inspector
between Theme default and an explicit alternative, then preview, reload the
draft, publish, and revert.

**Expect:** header, product cards, PDP, cart, and footer each change only their
owned surface; preview matches the published storefront; theme inheritance
returns exactly to the pinned preset; search, variant selection, quick-add,
quantity controls, checkout links, footer navigation, focus states, and mobile
controls remain functional in every treatment.

**TA-3.10 ★ — Video and newsletter are real storefront capabilities**

Test direct MP4/WebM, YouTube and Vimeo video with autoplay on/off, loop on/off,
controls on/off, missing poster, and reduced motion. Submit both footer and
section newsletter forms with invalid email, missing consent, a new email, a
repeat email, and a simulated persistence failure; inspect the owning store's
saved subscriber row.

**Expect:** video keeps its configured aspect and accessible label, embeds use
constructed privacy-safe URLs, and reduced-motion behavior satisfies TA-3.8.
Newsletter feedback is announced, a consent checkbox is required, the displayed
consent copy and source are recorded under the request-host store, repeat
submissions reactivate one store/email row, and no address crosses tenants or is
revealed through response wording.

**TA-3.11 ★ — The public catalog tells the release truth**

Open the theme on `themes.storemink.com`, filter to each declared industry, and
compare its card with `THEME_META`, signup, and the live demo.

**Expect:** name, description, preview, industries, plan gate, and availability
agree everywhere; hidden themes never render; blocked or unhealthy demos never
open a broken preview; a healthy preview uses the declared `demo-{id}` host;
catalog/signup links preserve the StoreMink platform host; keyboard focus,
mobile layout, canonical, robots host, sitemap host, and social preview all
belong to `themes.storemink.com` rather than a merchant store or the apex.

**TA-3.12 ★ — The catalog stays one compact, newest-first row**

Open `themes.storemink.com` at desktop, tablet and mobile widths.

**Expect:** every filtered theme stays in one horizontal, snap-aligned row;
touch/trackpad scrolling works natively and the visible previous/next buttons
move one card at a time, wrapping at either end. The latest `releasedAt` theme
is first. Cards are compact enough to show the preview, identity, features and
actions without occupying a full viewport height on desktop or mobile.

## 4. Accessibility and performance gate

**TA-4.1 — Automated accessibility**

Run the agreed browser accessibility scan on homepage, shop, product detail,
cart, and one content page.

**Pass:** no critical or serious violations and Lighthouse Accessibility ≥ 95.

**TA-4.2 — Keyboard and screen-reader smoke test**

Complete navigation, search, product selection, add-to-cart, cart editing, and
authentication-modal dismissal without a pointer.

**Pass:** logical focus order, visible focus, meaningful accessible names,
announced state changes, and no keyboard traps.

**TA-4.3 — Contrast**

Check every theme-controlled foreground/background pair, including hover,
disabled, sale, error, success, badge, header, and footer states.

**Pass:** WCAG AA for normal text and interactive components.

**TA-4.4 — Mobile performance**

Measure a production build with the pristine demo data.

**Pass:** Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90, LCP ≤ 2.5 s, CLS < 0.1, and INP ≤
200 ms. A lab run is evidence, not a substitute for production monitoring once
the theme is live.

**TA-4.5 ★ — Asset discipline**

Inspect the initial homepage request.

**Pass:** no theme downloads unused font families or original-resolution media
for a small render; the LCP image is correctly prioritized and sized.

## 5. Human design gate

Two reviewers are required: one product/design reviewer and one commerce/QA
reviewer. At least one must not have authored the theme.

Score every row from 1–5. Approval requires every row ≥ 4 and an average ≥ 4.2.

| Dimension              | What reviewers judge                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Art direction          | A coherent and intentional point of view, not a collection of fashionable effects.                                   |
| Distinctness           | Homepage, shop, product, cart, header, and footer cannot be mistaken for another StoreMink theme with new colors.    |
| Commerce clarity       | Discovery, price, variant, stock, add-to-cart, cart, and checkout affordances remain more important than decoration. |
| Typography             | Clear hierarchy, readable measures, suitable weights, and graceful long-content behavior.                            |
| Imagery                | Consistent crop language, useful focal points, licensed sources, and no obvious stock-photo collage.                 |
| Responsive composition | Mobile is deliberately composed rather than a collapsed desktop design.                                              |
| Detail quality         | Spacing, icons, borders, motion, empty states, and error states feel finished.                                       |
| Brand adaptability     | A merchant logo, primary color, and real catalog content can replace the seed without destroying the design.         |

Automatic rejection conditions:

- It is an existing StoreMink theme with only palette, font, radius, or section
  order changes.
- It copies another company's theme, screenshots, copy, or proprietary assets.
- The homepage is polished but shop, product, cart, or mobile views are generic
  or unfinished.
- It needs custom code to render its core advertised design.
- Placeholder copy or inaccessible text is visible in the demo.

## 6. Release evidence

Every Candidate keeps this evidence in its launch PR or linked release record:

| Evidence                                                           | Required                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Theme id and release/version                                       | Yes                           |
| CI run containing `lib/themes/themes.test.ts`                      | Yes                           |
| Live demo URL and route-health results                             | Yes                           |
| Desktop, tablet, and mobile screenshots for homepage/shop/PDP/cart | Yes                           |
| Browser matrix and date                                            | Yes                           |
| Accessibility report                                               | Yes                           |
| Production-build Lighthouse report                                 | Yes                           |
| Human scorecard with two reviewers                                 | Yes                           |
| Asset licenses/source log                                          | Yes                           |
| Known exceptions with owner and expiry                             | Only when an exception exists |

An exception cannot waive tenant isolation, broken purchasing, critical/serious
accessibility violations, or a non-working demo.

## 7. Current baseline — 2026-08-23

| Theme   | Package gate                                                                                                                   | Demo gate                                                                                                                                         | A11y/performance                                                                                                                              | Human gate                                                                            | Release state              |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Basket  | Passes the package gate; registered as preset `basket@1.0.0` on engine `storefront-grocery@1`                                  | **Production blocked:** public demo is still the StoreMink 404 and manifest preview is disabled.                                                  | Not recorded against this gate                                                                                                                | Prior visual review is historical and does not satisfy this release gate              | Blocked                    |
| Studio  | Passes the automated package gate as published preset `studio@0.1.0` on `storefront-editorial@1`; asset provenance is recorded | Production demos were reseeded and the desktop/tablet/mobile route and commerce sweep passed on 2026-08-12. Catalog and signup exposure are live. | Five-page accessibility is 98–100. **Performance remains open:** 67, LCP 7.26 s, CLS 0.008; anonymous-auth deferral awaits deployment/retest. | Not reviewed; authoring review does not count toward the two-reviewer gate            | Published; acceptance open |
| Ritual  | Passes the automated package gate as published preset `ritual@0.1.0` on `storefront-editorial@1`; asset provenance is recorded | Production demos were reseeded and the desktop/tablet/mobile route and commerce sweep passed on 2026-08-12. Catalog and signup exposure are live. | Five-page accessibility is 98–100. **Performance remains open:** 73, LCP 6.73 s, CLS 0; anonymous-auth deferral awaits deployment/retest.     | Not reviewed; authoring review does not count toward the two-reviewer gate            | Published; acceptance open |
| Vitrine | Passes the automated package gate as published preset `vitrine@0.1.0` on `storefront-classic@1`; asset provenance is recorded  | Production demo seeded and route-checked on 2026-08-22 (shop, PDP, content pages, all ten assets). Catalog and signup exposure are live.          | Passed; accessibility and Lighthouse gates confirmed on 2026-08-23                                                                            | Passed the required two-person review, including a non-author reviewer, on 2026-08-23 | Published                  |

The baseline is intentionally strict. Basket remains the default theme in code,
but it is not evidence that the new professional-theme acceptance bar has been
met. Studio and Ritual are public, but publication does not erase their open
performance and human-review gates; they must not be described as fully
approved until those rows close. Vitrine completed its accessibility,
Lighthouse and two-person human-review gates on 2026-08-23 and is now published
in the catalog and signup picker. Studio and Ritual's detailed production record
is `docs/theme-release-audit-2026-08-11.md`; Vitrine's gate closure is recorded
in this baseline and its asset log.
