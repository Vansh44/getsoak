/**
 * StoreMink's own brand identity for structured data — the platform entity, not

 *
 * This lives in one module because the SAME Organization node has to be emitted
 * from two hosts (the apex and help.storemink.com) under one `@id`. Two
 * hand-written copies would drift, and a drifted entity is worse than one
 * absent: search engines would see two different descriptions of the thing at
 * `https://storemink.com/#organization`.
 *
 * Pure — imports only dependency-free host and brand-asset constants.

/**
 * Official profiles, for schema.org `sameAs`.
 *
 * `sameAs` is an ASSERTION that these accounts are this organisation. It is one
 * of the strongest corroborating signals for a brand query, and it works both
 * ways round: each profile should also list storemink.com as its website, so
 * the claim can be confirmed rather than just made.
 *
 * Rules for this list, all of which cost real ranking if broken:
 *  - PUBLIC profile URLs only. An admin/dashboard URL
 *    (linkedin.com/company/<id>/admin/...) is behind a login and identifies a
 *    session, not the brand — it must never appear here.
 *  - Canonical form only. LinkedIn's own <link rel="canonical"> is
 *    /company/storemink, so no /home/ suffix and no trailing slash.
 *  - Only accounts we actually control. A wrong handle claims someone else's
 *    account is us.
 *
 * Verified live 2026-07-29: the YouTube and LinkedIn pages both carry the
 * StoreMink name and the site's own tagline; the Instagram payload carries the
 * display name "StoreMink" (a nonexistent handle's does not).
