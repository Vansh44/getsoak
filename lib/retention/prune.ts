// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Log retention — the sweep that deletes rows past their window.
//
// ── Why this file exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three tables grow forever and nothing ever pruned them. `email_logs.sql`
// documented a 90-day intent and even carries an `email_logs_created_idx`
// built "for retention sweeps"; `pruneNotifications` was written with correct
// windows and a docstring claiming it was "called by the daily cron". Nothing
// called it — grep returned the definition and nothing else. So the retention
// policy existed in three places as prose and in none as behaviour.
//
// ── ★ WHY THE CORE IS HERE AND NOT IN `app/actions/` ──────────────────────
// It used to live in `app/actions/notification-actions.ts`, a `"use server"`
// file — where EVERY export is a publicly reachable endpoint. `pruneNotifications`
// had no gate of any kind, ran under `withService` (which BYPASSES RLS), and took
// its retention windows as PARAMETERS. An unauthenticated caller passing zeroes
// would have deleted every notification, every email log, and the whole of
// `activity_events` — the append-only audit trail — across every store on the
// platform. Destroying the audit log is what an attacker does to cover their
// tracks, and this was the one endpoint that did it in a single call.
// This is the identical hazard CODEBASE.md §30 describes for
// `lib/domains/reconcile.ts`, and it gets the identical answer: the core lives
// in `lib/`, the route is the gate. Do not move it back.
//
// ── ★ EACH BATCH IS ITS OWN TRANSACTION ───────────────────────────────────
// `withService` wraps its callback in one BEGIN/COMMIT, so looping batches
// INSIDE a single call would be one enormous transaction — exactly what
// batching exists to avoid. The loop therefore calls `withService` per batch:
// locks are released between batches, WAL stays bounded, and a run that dies
// half way leaves the committed batches deleted. The sweep is idempotent and
// resumable, so the next night simply carries on.
