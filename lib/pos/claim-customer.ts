// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Adopting a till-created customer on signup (roadmap Step 4).
//
// ── ★★ ONE STATEMENT, AND EVERY GUARD INSIDE IT ────────────────────────────
// This rewrites a PRIMARY KEY that six other tables reference, so it is the
// single most dangerous write in the POS. It is therefore a conditional claim
// (roadmap invariant 3) with all four conditions in the WHERE — never
// check-then-act:
//
//   store_id = $store   the caller may not adopt another store's customer
//   phone    = $phone   from the VERIFIED auth identity, never from a form
//   id LIKE 'pos_%'     only a row the till invented
//   claimed_at IS NULL  and only one nobody has adopted already
//   NOT EXISTS (…$uid)  and only when this uid has no row of its own yet
//
// Two signups racing on one walk-in row: the loser matches zero rows and falls
// through to an ordinary insert. No lock, no window.
//
// ── Why the last condition is not optional ─────────────────────────────────
// `id` is the primary key. Someone who already has a `users` row — a returning
// shopper editing their profile — would hit a duplicate-key error instead of a
// clean no-op, and a raw PK violation surfacing on a profile save is both
// alarming and unactionable. Asking inside the statement keeps it a no-op.
//
// ── Why withService ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Customer RLS is `auth.uid() = users.id`, and the row being adopted has a
// `pos_…` id by definition — so under the customer's own scope it is invisible
// and the UPDATE would match nothing. Service scope is what makes the write
// possible; the WHERE clause above is what makes it safe. Same trade placeOrder
// makes (convention #12): validate first, then write privileged.

/**
 * ★★ THE CASCADE ONLY REACHES TABLES WITH A FOREIGN KEY, AND THREE THAT HOLD A

 *
 * `pos_13` put `ON UPDATE CASCADE` on all six FKs to `users.id`, which is what
 * makes adoption one statement — but `customer_credit_balances`,
 * `customer_credit_ledger` and `notifications`/`notification_email_queue` have
 * no FK at all, so the rewrite sails past them and leaves their rows pointing at
 * an id nobody can reach.
 *
 * ★ THE CREDIT TABLES ARE THE SERIOUS ONE: THEY HOLD MONEY. A walk-in refunded
 * to store credit at the till (§29) and then signing up would have their balance
 * orphaned BY THEIR OWN SIGNUP — the store's books still say it is owed, and the
 * customer's profile shows zero. Silent, and discovered by a complaint.
 *
 * ⚠ A HAND-WRITTEN LIST IS EXACTLY WHAT `pos_13` EXISTS TO AVOID, so keep this
 * one honest: `claim-customer.test.ts` pins every table named here, and a new
 * table holding a customer id belongs in this function OR behind a real FK.
 * Prefer the FK. The risk here is narrower than the one the migration replaced —
 * these are UPDATEs, so forgetting one orphans data rather than
 * cascade-DELETING somebody's orders — but orphaned money is still money.
 *
 * ★ `notification_preferences` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. The customer audience has
 * no preference layer (§24 — transactional mail is not switchable), so a
 * `pos_` customer can never have a row there.
