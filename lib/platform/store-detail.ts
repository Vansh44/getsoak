// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Everything an operator needs to know about ONE store, on one screen.
//
// ── ★ WHY THIS IS NOT IN `app/actions/platform.ts` ─────────────────────────
// Every export of a `"use server"` file is a publicly reachable endpoint. This
// is a pure READ called by a server component that has already resolved the
// viewer, so exporting it as an action would add a public endpoint returning
// cross-tenant data for no benefit. Same reasoning as `lib/domains/reconcile.ts`
// (§30) and `lib/retention/prune.ts` (§32): the core lives in `lib/`, the gate
// lives at the entry point. It gates again anyway — defence in depth is cheap
// when the cost of being wrong is every store's data.
//
// ── ★ ONE ROUND TRIP, NOT FIFTEEN ──────────────────────────────────────────
// A store detail wants ~15 counts. Issued separately that is 15 × the ~46ms
// round trip to Cloud SQL in Mumbai (docs/local-dev-performance.md), i.e. most
// of a second spent waiting before React starts. They go in one statement of
// scalar subqueries, the shape `getPlatformOverview` already uses.
//
// ── ★ IT NEVER RETURNS A SECRET ────────────────────────────────────────────
// Channel state is "connected / paused / none" and nothing else. The gateway,
// logistics and SMS credentials are encrypted at rest and write-only by design
// (§18, §35, §37); an operator console is not a reason to widen that.
