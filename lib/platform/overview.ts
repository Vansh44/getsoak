// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The operator home screen's data.
//
// ── ★ AN OVERVIEW ANSWERS "WHAT NEEDS ME?", NOT "HOW MANY OF EVERYTHING?" ──
// A wall of totals looks like a dashboard and is read once. The `attention`
// block is the part that earns the screen: every number in it is a queue with
// a destination, and every one of them is zero on a good day. Counts that
// never demand action (total stores, plan mix) are context around it, not the
// point of it — the same rule §22 states for sidebar badges, where a hardcoded
// "12" on Orders taught people to ignore the badges that moved.
//
// ── ★ EVERY FIGURE HERE IS DERIVED, NOTHING IS STORED ──────────────────────
// So there is no counter to drift, no backfill, and no "recompute the
// dashboard" job. It costs one round trip (see store-detail.ts on why that
// matters), which is the whole reason these are scalar subqueries rather than
// fifteen awaits.
//
// ── ★ IT FAILS TO AN EMPTY SNAPSHOT, NOT AN EXCEPTION ──────────────────────
// This is the screen an operator opens when something is wrong. A page that
// 500s because one aggregate failed is the worst possible behaviour for it,
// so a read error logs and renders zeroes; `ok: false` tells the page to say
// so rather than present zeroes as good news.
