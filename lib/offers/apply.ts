// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The offer engine — pure. `docs/offers-plan.md` §9, §10.
//
// ★ ONE IMPLEMENTATION, CALLED BY EVERY SURFACE: `placeOrder` (the charge),
// `placePosSale` (the charge at the till), `posTotals` (what the cashier
// quotes), the cart/checkout summary (what the shopper sees), and the offer
// editor's historical replay. This is not a style preference — it is the
// `posTotals` incident, where the till screen quoted ₹238 and the server
// charged ₹249.90, so ₹300 cash came back ₹50.10 instead of the promised ₹62
// while the same panel said "Paid in full ₹238". An engine reachable only from
// `placeOrder` guarantees a second implementation appears for the till.
//
// The server still re-reads prices, stock and rates from the database and
// re-resolves which offers are live. This file is ARITHMETIC, not
// authorisation: nothing a client sends about an offer is trusted beyond a
// code string.
//
// ── BEST OFFER WINS (owner, 2026-09-02) ───────────────────────────────────
// Exclusive selection BY VALUE. One offer per line, one order-level offer.
// `priority` is a tie-break, not a selector.
//
// ★ IT IS A BOUNDED SCENARIO COMPARISON, NOT A SEARCH. Optimal assignment over
// N overlapping offers is exponential and its cost would scale with how many
// offers a merchant happens to create; a till cannot spend 200ms on it. So we
// evaluate a bounded set of scenario SHAPES and take the best-scoring one:
//
//   line_and_order   line offers claim their lines; the order offer claims the rest
//   order_only       the order offer claims every line; no line offers
//   line_only        line offers only (also the base case when no order offer exists)
//
// The first two are evaluated once per order-level candidate, so the total is
// `2 × |orderCandidates| + 1`, each O(lines × lineCandidates), with every term
// bounded by MAX_EVALUATED_OFFERS.
//
// ★ WHY `order_only` IS NOT DOMINATED BY `line_and_order`, which is the thing
// that makes this comparison worth doing at all. Because a line carries at
// most ONE offer, a line claimed by a line-level offer is REMOVED from the
// order offer's base. So: 5% off Shakes (a ₹100 line → ₹5) plus 20% off order,
// on a cart of ₹100 shakes + ₹900 other —
//     line_and_order = ₹5 + 20% × ₹900 = ₹185
//     order_only     =      20% × ₹1,000 = ₹200   ← wins
// A merchant's small category discount must not cost the shopper the bigger
// order discount. If exclusivity ever changes so that both can touch one line,
// this comparison becomes redundant and should be deleted, not left running.
//
// ★ `line_only` IS PROVABLY DOMINATED BY `line_and_order` (the order offer
// contributes ≥ 0 to the same line set) and is evaluated anyway, because it is
// the only scenario available when there are no order-level candidates. Do not
// "optimise" it away as dead — it is the base case.
