// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Draining the announcement queue.
//
// ── ★ IT RIDES THE EXISTING EMAIL HEARTBEAT ────────────────────────────────
// `/api/cron/send-emails` already drains two email queues and the SMS queue;
// this is a fourth. §37's reason, restated: a separate Cloud Scheduler entry is
// one more thing to create and one more thing to forget, and
// `docs/cron-jobs.md` records that happening three times already.
//
// ── ★ EVERY MESSAGE LEAVES THROUGH `sendEmail` ─────────────────────────────
// The choke point (§24), so every announcement lands in `email_logs` with the
// `announcement` mailer — which is what makes "did this merchant get the
// pricing notice?" answerable at all. `send-coverage.test.ts` enforces it.
//
// ── ★ SINGLE SENDS, NOT A BATCH ────────────────────────────────────────────
// The coupon worker batches through Resend because it sends one identical body
// to thousands. So does this — but the per-recipient row is the auditable
// record, and `sendEmailBatch` reports per-message outcomes that would then
// have to be mapped back onto rows by index. At announcement volumes
// (hundreds, not hundreds of thousands) the simpler path is worth more than
// the round trips, and it is the path that keeps one bad address from
// obscuring which row failed.
