//
//   • EVERY event in this catalog is RECORDED in activity_events. That is the
//     audit trail (/dashboard/logs) — complete by construction.
//   • Only events with a non-empty `audiences` entry are FANNED OUT into
//     someone's inbox. An event with `audiences: {}` is audit-only: visible in
//     the feed, silent in the bell. That is how a busy store gets a full
//     history without 400 unread badges a day.
//
// Adding a notification is therefore ONE entry here: the preferences matrix,
// the routing, and the settings UI all derive from this list — exactly like
// permissions.ts and lib/settings/registry.ts.
//
// Pure module (no server imports) so server actions, the client preference
// editor, and tests can all import it.
