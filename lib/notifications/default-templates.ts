// Default email copy for every notification.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the bell needs one short line ("New order ORD10010004 ·
// ₹1,240"); an email needs a subject, an opening line, the details laid out so
// they can be scanned, and a reason to click. Using the bell's line as an email
// body left the console's Message box looking empty and the mail itself thin.
//
// The copy is TEMPLATE TEXT — the same {{tokens}} a merchant can edit — so what
// the console shows as the placeholder is exactly what would be sent, and
// "customise this" starts from something already good rather than a blank box.
//
// Bodies are built from the event's own declared variables (variables.ts), so a
// new event gets a sensible email for free and no template can reference a
// value its emitter doesn't provide.
//
// Pure module: no DB, no server imports.
