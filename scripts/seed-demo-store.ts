/**
 * Seed (or reseed) a theme's demo store — the showcase behind the signup
 * picker's Preview link and the public theme catalog.
 *
 *   npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.scripts.json scripts/seed-demo-store.ts vitrine
 *
 * ⚠ `--tsconfig` is NOT optional: lib/themes/apply.ts imports `next/cache`,
 * whose revalidation helpers throw outside a request scope, and the db client
 * chain imports `server-only`. That tsconfig maps both to scripts/_stubs/.
 *
 * ⚠ CHECK WHICH DATABASE YOU ARE SEEDING. `.env` points at STAGING
 * (DB_NAME=storemink_staging), and staging + prod are two databases in ONE
 * Cloud SQL instance, so the proxy being up says nothing about which one you
 * hit. A shell variable beats .env, so PRODUCTION is:
 *
 *   DB_NAME=storemink npx tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.scripts.json \
 *     scripts/seed-demo-store.ts vitrine
 *
 * This is the same work app/actions/platform.ts's `seedDemoStore` does, minus
 * its `requireSuperadmin()` gate — that reads a session cookie and cannot be
 * satisfied outside a request. Prefer the Themes panel on the platform stores
 * console when you have an operator login; use this when you do not.
 *
 * Idempotent: the store row is created only when missing, and applyTheme
 * upserts on (store_id, slug) with reset:true, which is refused unless the
 * store is marked `settings.demo === true`. Re-running restores a demo that
 * someone has clicked around in.
 *
 * ⚠ Revalidation is a no-op here (see scripts/_stubs/next-cache.ts), so an
 * already-running server can serve stale cached reads for up to 300s. A NEW
 * store host resolves immediately — negative host lookups are never cached.
