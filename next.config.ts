  // survives that, and it covers non-HTML responses (JSON, XML, images) too.
  //
  // Gated on the same SEARCH_INDEXABLE rule as robots.ts / sitemap.ts, derived
  // from the baked NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN — so staging, `*.staging`, Cloud Run

  // ★ HSTS IS SET HERE TOO, and it is the half that stops a repeat of the
  // pos.storemink.com outage. The load balancer had no port-80 rule at all, so

  // know it should have used HTTPS, so a freshly TYPED host (no history entry
  // to autocomplete a scheme from) failed outright. The LB redirect fixes the
  // request; this stops the request being made over HTTP in the first place.
  //
  // ⚠ `includeSubDomains` is applied to OUR root domain ONLY. On storemink.com
  // that is exactly the point — one visit to the apex protects `pos.`, `help.`,
  // `themes.` and every merchant subdomain, which is what the incident needed.
  // On a MERCHANT'S custom domain it would be an overreach: we serve `acme.com`
  // over HTTPS, but `blog.acme.com` may be theirs, elsewhere, on plain HTTP,
  // and pinning it is not ours to do. Custom domains therefore get the bare
  // directive for their own host.
  //
  // No `preload`: the list is slow to leave, so it is a deliberate later step,
  // not something to inherit from a copy-pasted snippet.
  //
  // Skipped in development — the header is ignored over plain HTTP by spec
  // (RFC 6797 §8.1), so this is belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing.
